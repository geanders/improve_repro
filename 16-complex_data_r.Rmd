## Complex data types in R and Bioconductor

Many R extension packages for pre-processing experimental data use complex
(rather than 'tidy') data formats within their code, and many output data in
complex formats. Very recently, the *broom* and *biobroom* R
packages have been developed to extract a 'tidy' dataset from a complex data
format. These tools create a clean, simple connection between the complex data
formats often used in pre-processing experimental data and the 'tidy' format
required to use the 'tidyverse' tools now taught in many introductory R courses.
In this module, we will describe the 'list' data structure, the common backbone
for complex data structures in R and provide tips on how to explore and extract
data stored in R in this format, including through the *broom* and
*biobroom* packages.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Describe the structure of R's 'list' data format 
- Take basic steps to explore and extract data stored in R's complex, list-based
structures
- Describe what the *broom* and *biobroom* R packages can do 
- Explain how converting data to a 'tidy' format can improve reproducibility
