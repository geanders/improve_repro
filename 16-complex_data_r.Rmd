## Separating data recording and analysis

Many biomedical laboratories use spreadsheets, with embedded formulas, to both
record and analyze experimental data. This practice impedes transparency and
reproducibility of both data recording and data analysis. In this module, we
will describe this common practice and will outline alternative approaches that
separate the steps of data recording and data analysis.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Explain the difference between data recording and data analysis 
- Understand why collecting data on spreadsheets with embedded formulas impedes 
reproducibility 
- List alternative approaches to improve reproducibility

### Data recording versus data analysis

### Common practices combining recording and analysis

### Hazards of combining recording and analysis

### Approaches to separate recording and analysis

### Discussion questions
