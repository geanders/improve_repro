## Complex data types in R and Bioconductor

Many R extension packages for pre-processing experimental data use complex
(rather than 'tidy') data formats within their code, and many output data in
complex formats. Very recently, the *broom* and *biobroom* R
packages have been developed to extract a 'tidy' dataset from a complex data
format. These tools create a clean, simple connection between the complex data
formats often used in pre-processing experimental data and the 'tidy' format
required to use the 'tidyverse' tools now taught in many introductory R courses.
In this module, we will describe the 'list' data structure, the common backbone
for complex data structures in R and provide tips on how to explore and extract
data stored in R in this format, including through the *broom* and
*biobroom* packages.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Describe the structure of R's 'list' data format 
- Take basic steps to explore and extract data stored in R's complex, list-based
structures
- Describe what the *broom* and *biobroom* R packages can do 
- Explain how converting data to a 'tidy' format can improve reproducibility

### Subsection 1

> "Object-oriented design doesn't have to be over-complicated design, but we've 
observed that too often it is. Too many OO designs are spaghetti-like tangles of 
is-a and has-a relationships, or feature thick layers of glue in which many of the
objects seem to exist simply to hold places in a steep-sided pyramid of abstractions. 
Such designs are the opposite of transparent; they are (notoriously) opaque and 
difficult to debug." [@raymond2003art]

> "Unix programmers are the original zealots about modularity, but tend to go about it
in a quiter way [that with OOP]. Keeping glue layers thin is part of it; more generally, 
our tradition teaches us to build lower, hugging the ground with algorithms and structures
that are designed to be simple and transparent." [@raymond2003art]
