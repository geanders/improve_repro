## Complex data types in R and Bioconductor

Many R extension packages for pre-processing experimental data use complex
(rather than 'tidy') data formats within their code, and many output data in
complex formats. Very recently, the *broom* and *biobroom* R
packages have been developed to extract a 'tidy' dataset from a complex data
format. These tools create a clean, simple connection between the complex data
formats often used in pre-processing experimental data and the 'tidy' format
required to use the 'tidyverse' tools now taught in many introductory R courses.
In this module, we will describe the 'list' data structure, the common backbone
for complex data structures in R and provide tips on how to explore and extract
data stored in R in this format, including through the *broom* and
*biobroom* packages.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Describe the structure of R's 'list' data format 
- Take basic steps to explore and extract data stored in R's complex, list-based
structures
- Describe what the *broom* and *biobroom* R packages can do 
- Explain how converting data to a 'tidy' format can improve reproducibility

### Subsection 1

> "Object-oriented design doesn't have to be over-complicated design, but we've 
observed that too often it is. Too many OO designs are spaghetti-like tangles of 
is-a and has-a relationships, or feature thick layers of glue in which many of the
objects seem to exist simply to hold places in a steep-sided pyramid of abstractions. 
Such designs are the opposite of transparent; they are (notoriously) opaque and 
difficult to debug." [@raymond2003art]

> "Unix programmers are the original zealots about modularity, but tend to go about it
in a quiter way [that with OOP]. Keeping glue layers thin is part of it; more generally, 
our tradition teaches us to build lower, hugging the ground with algorithms and structures
that are designed to be simple and transparent." [@raymond2003art]

> "A *standard* is a precise and detailed description of how some artifact is built
or is supposed to work. Examples of software standards include programming 
languages (the definition of syntax and semantics), data formats (how information is
represented), algorithmic processing (the steps necessary to do a computation), and
the like. Some standards, like the Word `.doc` file format, are *de facto* standards---they
have no official standing but everyoen uses them. The word 'standard' is best reserved for
formal descriptions, often developed and maintained by a quasi-neutral party like a 
government or a consortium, that define how something is built or operated. The definition 
is sufficiently complete and precise that separate entities can interact or provide independent
implementations. We benefit from hardware standards all the time, though we may not notice 
how many there are. If I buy a new television set, I can plug it inot the electrical outlets
in my home thanks to standards for the size and shape of plugs and the voltage they provide. 
The set itself will receive signals and display pictures because of standards for broadcast
and cable television. I can plug other devices into it through standard cables and connectors 
like HDMI, USB, S-video and so on. But every TV needs its own remote control and every cell
phone needs a different charger because those have not been standardized. Computing has plenty
of standards as well, including character sets like ASCII and Unicode, programming languages
like C and C++, algorithms for encryption and compression, and protocols for exchanging
information over networks." [@kernighan2011d]

> "Standards are important. They make it possible for independently created things to cooperate, 
and they open an area to competition from multiple suppliers, while proprietary systems tend
to lock everyone in. ... Standards have disadvantages, too---a standard can impede progress if
it is inferior or outdated yet everyone is forced to use it. But these are modest drawbacks
compared to the advantages." [@kernighan2011d]

> "A *class* is a blueprint for constructing a particular package of code and data; each 
variable created according to a class's blueprint is known as an *object* of that class. 
Code outside of a class that creates and uses an object of that class is known as a *client*
of the class. A *class declaration* names the class and lists all of the *members*, or 
items inside that class. Each item is either a *data member*---a variable declared within the
class---or a *method* (also known as a *member function*), which is a function declared within
the class. Member functions can include a special type called a *constructor*, which has the 
same name as the class and is invoked implicitly when an object of the class is declared. 
In addition to the normal attributes of a variable or function declaration (such as type, and 
for functions, the parameter list), each member has an *access specifier*, which indicates 
what functions can access the member. A *public member* can be accessed by any code using the 
object: code inside the class, a client of the class, or code in a *subclass*, which is a class
that 'inherits' all the code and data of an existing class. A *private member* can be 
accessed only by the code inside the class. *Protected members* ... are similar to private 
members, except that methods in subclasses can also reference them. Both private and 
protected members, though, are inaccessible from client code." [@spraul2012think]

> "An object should be a meaningful, closely knit collection of data and code that operates
on the data." [@spraul2012think]

> "Recognizing a situation in which a class would be useful is essential to reaching the 
higher levels of programming style, but it's equally important to recognize situations in 
which a class is going to make things worse." [@spraul2012think]

> "The word *encapsulation* is a fancy way of saying that classes put multiple pieces of 
data and code together in a single package. If you've ever seen a gelatin medicine capsule
filled with little spheres, that's a good analogy: The patient takes one capsule and swallows
all the individual ingredient spheres inside. ... From a problem-solving standpoint, 
encapsulation allows us to more easily reuse the code from previous problems to solve current
problems. Often, even though we have worked on a problem similar to our current project, 
reusing what we learned before still takes a lot of work. A fully encapsulated class can 
work like an external USB drive; you just plug it in and it works. FOr this to happen, 
though, we must design the class correctly to make sure that the code and data is truly 
encapsulated and as independent as possible from anything outside of the class. For example, 
a class that references a global variable can't be copied into a new project without 
copying the global variable, as well." [@spraul2012think]

> "Beyond reusing classes from one program to the next, classes offer the potential for
a more immediate form of code reuse: inheritance. ... Using inheritance, we create parent
classes with methods common to two or more child classes, thereby 'factoring out' not 
just a few lines of code [as with helper functions in procedural code] but whole methods."
[@spraul2012think]

> "One technique we're returned to again and again is dividing a complex problem into 
smaller, more manageable pieces. Classes are great at dividing programs up into functional
units. Encapsulation not only holds data and code together in a reusable package; it also
cordons off that data and code from the rest of the program, allowing us to work on that 
class, and everything else separately. The more classes we make in a program, the greater
the problem-dividing effect." [@spraul2012think]

> "Some people use the terms *information hiding* and *encapsulation* interchangeable, but
we'll separate the ideas here. As described previously ..., encapsulation is 
packaging data and code together. Information hiding means separating the interface of a 
data structure---the definition of the operations and their parameters---from the implementation
of a data structure, or the code inside the functions. If a class has been written with 
information hiding as a goal, then it's possible to change the implementation of the methods
without requiring any changes in the client code (the code that uses the class). Again, we
have to be clear on the term *interface*; this means not only the name of the methods and
their parameter list but also the explanation (perhaps expressed in code documentation) of 
what the different methods do. When we talk about changing the implementation without 
changing the interface, we mean that we change *how* the class methods work but not 
*what* they do. Some programming authors have referred to this as a kind of implicit contract
between the class and the client: The class agrees never to change the effects of 
existing operations, and the client agrees to use the class strictly on the basis of its
interface and to ignore any implementation details." [@spraul2012think]

> "So how does information hiding affect problem solving? The principle of information hiding 
tells the programmer to put aside the class implementation details when working on the 
client code, or more broadly, to be concerned about a particular class's implementation
only when working inside that class. When you can put implementation details out of your
mind, you can eliminate distracting thoughts and concentrate on solving the problem at hand."
[@spraul2012think]

> "A final goal of a well-designed class is expressiveness, or what might be broadly called
writability---the ease with which code can be written. A good class, once written, makes
the rest of the code simpler to write in the way that a good function makes code simpler to
write. Classes effectively extend a language, becoming high-level counterparts to basic
low-level features such as loops, if statements, and so forth. ... With classes, programming
actions that previously took many steps can be done in just a few steps or just one."
[@spraul2012think]

> "When we are writing code in a programming language, we work most of the time with RAM, 
combining and restructuring data values to produce new values in RAM. ... The computer memory
in RAM is a series of 0's and 1's, just like the computer memory used to store files in mass
storage. In order to work with data values, we need to get those values into RAM in some
format. At the basic level of representing a single number or a single piece of text, the 
solution is the same as it was in Chapter 5 [on file formats for mass storage]. Everything
is represented as a pattern of bits, using various numbers of bytes for different sorts of
values. In R, in an English locale, and on a 32-bit operating system, a single character
usually takes up one byte, an
