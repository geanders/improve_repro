<p>The R extension package RMarkdown can be used to create documents that combine
code and text in a ‘knitted’ document, and it has become a popular tool for
improving the computational reproducibility and efficiency of the data analysis
stage of research. This tool can also be used earlier in the research process,
however, to improve reproducibility of pre-processing steps. In this module, we
will provide detailed instructions on how to use RMarkdown in RStudio to create
documents that combine code and text. We will show how an RMarkdown document
describing a data pre-processing protocol can be used to efficiently apply the
same data pre-processing steps to different sets of raw data.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define RMarkdown and the documents it can create</li>
<li>Explain how RMarkdown can be used to improve the reproducibility of research
projects at the data pre-processing phase</li>
<li>Create a document in RStudio using RMarkdown</li>
<li>Describe more advanced features of RMarkdown and where you can find out more
about them</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p>In the last module (3.7), we described what knitted documents are, as well as the
advantages of using knitted documents to create data pre-processing protocols
for common pre-processing tasks in your research group. We also described the
key elements of creating a knitted document, regardless of the software system
you are using. In this module, we will
go into more detail about how you can create these documents using R and
RStudio, and in the next module (3.9) we will walk through an example data
pre-processing protocol created using this method. We strongly recommend that
you read the previous module (3.7) before working through this one.</p>
<p>R has a special format for creating knitted documents called <em>RMarkdown</em>. In the
previous module, we talked about the elements of a knitted document, and later
in this module we’ll walk through how they apply to RMarkdown. However, the
easiest way to learn how to use RMarkdown is to try an example, so we’ll start
with a very basic one. If you’d like to try it yourself, you’ll need to download
R and RStudio. The RStudio IDE can be downloaded and installed as a free
software, as long as you use the personal version (Posit, the company that
created RStudio, creates higher-powered versions for corporate use).</p>
<p>Like other plain text documents, an RMarkdown file should be edited using a text
editor, rather than a word processor like Word or Google Docs. It is easiest to
use the RStudio IDE as the text editor when creating and editing an R markdown
document, as this IDE has incorporated some helpful functionality for working
with plain text documents for RMarkdown. In RStudio, you can create a number of
types of new files through the “File” menu. To create a new R markdown file,
open RStudio and then choose “New File”, then choose “RMarkdown” from the
choices in that menu. Figure <a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdownnewfile">19.1</a> shows an example of
what this menu option looks like.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>This will open a window with some options you can specify some of the overall
information about the document (Figure <a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdownchoices">19.2</a>), including
the title and the author. You can specify the output format that you would
like. Possible output formats include HTML, Word, and PDF. You should be able to
use the HTML and Word output formats without any additional software, so we’ll start
there with this example. If you
would like to use the PDF output, you will need to install one other piece of
software: Miktex for Windows, MacTex for Mac, or TeX Live for Linux. These are
all pieces of software with an underlying TeX engine and all are open-source and
free. The example in the next module was created as a PDF using one of these tools.</p>

</div>
<p>Once you have selected the options in this menu you can choose the “Okay” button
(Figure <a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdownchoices">19.2</a>). This will open a new document. This
document, however, won’t be blank. Instead it will include an example document
written in RMarkdown (Figure <a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdowntemplate">19.3</a>). This example
document helps you navigate how the RMarkdown process works, by letting you test
out a sample document. It also gives you a starting point—once you understand
how the example document works, you can edit it and change it to convert it
into the document you would like to create.</p>

</div>
<p>If you have not used RMarkdown before, it is very helpful to try knitting this
example document before making changes, to explore how pieces in the document
align with elements in the rendered output document. Once you are
familiar with the line-up between elements in this file in the output document,
you can delete parts of the example file and insert your own text and code.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through and explore this example document, aligning it
with the formatted output document (Figure <a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">19.4</a>).
First, to render this or any RMarkdown document, if you are in RStudio you can
use the “Knit” button at the top of the file, as shown in Figure
<a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdowntemplate2">19.5</a>. When you click on this button, it will render the
entire document to the output format you’ve selected (HTML, PDF, or Word). This
rendering process will both run the executable code and apply all formatting.
The final output (Figure <a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">19.4</a>, right) will pop up
in a new window. As you start with RMarkdown, it is useful to look at this
output to see how it compares with the plain text RMarkdown file (Figure
<a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">19.4</a>, left).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>You will also notice, after you first render the document, that your working
directory has a new file with this output document. For example, if you are
working to create an HTML document using an RMarkdown file called
“my_report.Rmd”, once you knit your RMarkdown file, you will notice a new file
in your working directory called “my_report.html”. This new file is your output
file, the one that you would share with colleagues as a report. You should
consider this output document to be “read-only”—in other words, you can read and
share this document, but you should not make any changes directly to this
document, since they will be overwritten anytime you re-render the original
RMarkdown document.</p>
<p>Next, let’s compare the example RMarkdown document (the one that is given when
you first open an RMarkdown file in RStudio) with the output file that is
created when you render this example document (Figure
<a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">19.4</a>). If you look at the output document (Figure
<a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">19.4</a>, right), you can notice how different elements
align with pieces in the original RMarkdown file (Figure
<a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">19.4</a>). For example, the output document includes a
header with the text “R Markdown”. This second-level header is created by the
Markdown notation in the original file of:</p>
<pre><code>## R Markdown</code></pre>
<p>This header is formatted in a larger font than other text, and on a separate
line—the exact formatting is specified within the style file for the RMarkdown
document, and will be applied to all second-level headers in the document. You
can also see formatting specified through things like bold font for the word
“Knit”, through the Markdown syntax <code>**Knit**</code>, and a clickable link specified
through the syntax <code>&lt;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&gt;</code>. At the beginning of the
original document, you can see how elements like the title, author, date, and
output format are specified in the YAML. Finally, you can see that special
character combinations demarcate sections of executable code.</p>
<p>Let’s look a little more closely in the next part of the module at how these
elements of the RMarkdown document work.</p>
</div>
<div id="formatting-text-with-markdown-in-rmarkdown" class="section level2" number="19.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">19.2</span> Formatting text with Markdown in RMarkdown<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#formatting-text-with-markdown-in-rmarkdown"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>If you remember from the last module, one element of knitted documents is
that they are written in plain text, with all the formatting specified
using a markup language.
For the main text in an RMarkdown document, all formatting is done using
Markdown as the markup language. Markdown is a popular markup language, in part
because it is a good bit simpler than other markup languages like HTML or LaTeX.
This simplicity means that it is not quite as expressive as other markup
languages. However, Markdown probably provides adequate formatting for at least 90% of the
formatting you will typically want to do for a research report or
pre-processing protocol, and by staying simpler, it is much easier to learn the
Markdown syntax quickly compared to other markup languages.</p>
<p>As with other markup languages, Markdown uses special characters or combinations of characters to indicate formatting within the plain text of the original document. When the document is rendered, these markings are used by the software to create the formatting that you have specified in the final output document. Some example formatting symbols and conventions for Markdown include:</p>
<ul>
<li>to format a word or phrase in bold, surround it with two asterisks (<code>**</code>)</li>
<li>to format a word or phrase in italics, surround it with one asterisk (<code>*</code>)</li>
<li>to create a first-level header, put the header text on its own line, starting the line with <code>#</code>
</li>
<li>to create a second-level header, put the header text on its own line, starting the line with <code>##</code>
</li>
<li>separate paragraphs with empty lines</li>
<li>use hyphens to create bulleted lists</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to keep in mind when using Markdown, in terms of formatting, is that
white space can be very important in specifying the formatting. For example when
you specify a new paragraph, you must leave a blank line from your previous
text. Similarly when you use a hash (<code>#</code>) to indicate a header, you must leave a
blank space after the hash before the word or phrase that you want to be used in
that header. To create a section header, you would write:</p>
<pre><code># Initial Data Inspection</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, if you forgot the space after the hash sign, like this:</p>
<pre><code>#Initial Data Inspection</code></pre>
<p>then in your ouput document you would get this:</p>
<p>#Initial Data Inspection</p>
<p>Similarly, white space is needed to separate paragraphs. For example, this would create two paragraphs:</p>
<pre><code>This is a first paragraph. 

This is a second.</code></pre>
<p>Meanwhile this would create one:</p>
<pre><code>This is a first paragraph.
This is still part of the first paragraph.</code></pre>
<p>The syntax of Markdown is fairly simple and can be learned quickly. For more
details on this syntax, you can refer to the RMarkdown reference guide at
<a href="https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf" class="uri">https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf</a>. The
basic formatting rules for Markdown are also covered in some more
extensive resources for RMarkdown that we will point you to later in this
module.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">19.3</span> Preambles in RMarkdown documents<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preambles-in-rmarkdown-documents"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In the previous module, we explained how knitted documents include a
preamble to specify some metadata about the document, including elements
like the title, authors, and output format. In R, this preamble is
created using YAML. In this subsection, we provide some more details
on using this YAML section in RMarkdown documents.</p>
<p>In an RMarkdown document, the YAML is a special section
at the top of an RMarkdown document (the original, plain text file, not the
rendered version). It is set off from the rest of the document using a special
combination of characters, using a process very similar to how executable code
is set off from other text with a special set of characters so it can be easily
identified by the software program that renders the document. For the YAML, this
combination of characters is three hyphens (<code>---</code>) on a line by themselves to
start the YAML section and then another three on a line by themselves to end it.
Here is an example of what the YAML might look like at the top of an RMarkdown
document:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: "Laboratory report for example project"
author: "Brooke Anderson"
date: "1/12/2020"
output: word_document
---</code></pre>
<p>Within the YAML itself, you can specify different options for your document.
You can change simple things like the title, author, and date, but you can
also change more complex things, including how the output document is rendered.
For each thing that you want to specify, you specify it with a special
keyword for that option and then a valid choice for that keyword. The idea
is very similar to setting parameter values in a function call in R. For
example, the <code>title:</code> keyword is a valid one in RMarkdown YAML. It allows you
to set the words that will be printed in the title space, using title formatting,
in your output document. It can take any string of characters, so you can put in
any text for the title that you’d like, as long as you surround it with quotation
marks. The <code>author:</code> and <code>date:</code> keywords work in similar ways. The <code>output:</code>
keyword allows you to specify the output that the document should be rendered to.
In this case, the keyword can only take one of a few set values, including
<code>word_document</code> to output a Word document, <code>pdf_document</code> to output a pdf
document (see later in this section for some more set-up required to make that
work), and <code>html_document</code> to output an HTML document.</p>
<p>As you start using RMarkdown, you will be able to do a lot without messing with
the YAML much. In fact, you can get a long way without ever changing the values
in the YAML from the default values they are given when you first create an
RMarkdown document. As you become more familiar with R, you may want to learn
more about how the YAML works and how you can use it to customize your
document—it turns out that quite a lot can be set in the YAML to do very
interesting customizations in your final rendered document. The book <em>R
Markdown: The Definitive Guide</em>,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Yihui Xie, Joseph J Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund, &lt;em&gt;R Markdown: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt; (CRC Press, 2018).&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>337</sup></a></span> which is available free online, has
sections discussing YAML choices for both HTML and pdf output, at
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html</a> and
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html</a>, respectively. There is

</h2>
<p>In the previous module, we described how knitted documents use special markers
to indicate where sections of executable code start and stop. In RMarkdown,
the markers you will use to indicate executable code look like this:</p>
<pre><code>```r{}
my_object &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)
```</code></pre>
<p>In RMarkdown, the following combination indicates
the start of executable code:</p>
<p><code>```{r}</code></p>
<p>while this combination indicates the end of executable code (in other
words the start of regular text):</p>
<p><code>```</code></p>
<p>In the example above, we have shown the most basic
version of the markup character combination used to specify the start of
executable code (<code>```{r}</code>). This character combination can be expanded,
however, to include some specifications for how you want the code in the section
following it to be run, as well as how you want output to be shown. For example,
you could use the following indications to specify that the code should be run,
but the code itself should not be printed in the final document, by specifying
<code>echo = FALSE</code>, as well as that the created figure should be centered on the
page, by specifying <code>fig.align = "center"</code>:</p>
<p><code>```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}</code></p>
<p>There are numerous options that can be used to specify how the code will be run.
These specifications are called
<em>chunk options</em>, and you specify them in the special character combination
where you mark the start of executable code. For example, you can specify that
the code should be printed in the document, but not executed, by setting the
<code>eval</code> parameter to <code>FALSE</code> with <code>```{r eval = FALSE}</code> as the marker to
start the code section.</p>
<p>The chunk options also include <code>echo</code>, which can be used to specify whether to
print the code in that code chunk when the document is rendered. For some
documents, it is useful to print out the code that is executed, where for other
documents you may not want that printed. For example, for a pre-processing
protocol, you are aiming to show yourself and others how the pre-processing was
done. In this case, it is very helpful to print out all of the code, so that
future researchers who read that protocol can clearly see each step. By
contrast, if you are using RMarkdown to create a report or an article that is
focused on the results of your analysis, it may make more sense to instead hide
the code in the final document.</p>
<p>As part of the code options, you can also specify whether messages and warnings
created when running the code should be included in the document output, and
there are number of code chunk options that specify how tables and figures
rendered by the code should be shown. For more details on the possible options
that can be specified for how code is evaluated within an executable chunk of
code, you can refer to the RMarkdown cheat sheet available at
<a href="https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf" class="uri">https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf</a></p>
<p>RStudio has some functionality that is useful when you are working with code in
RMarkdown documents. Within each code chuck are some buttons that can be used to
test out the code in that chunk of executable code. One is the green right arrow
key to the right at the top of the code chunk, highlighted in Figure
<a href="module19.html#fig:rmarkdowntemplate2">19.5</a>. This button will run all of the code in that
chunk and show you the output in an output field that will open directly below
the code chunk. This functionality allows you to explore the code in your
document as you build it, rather than waiting until you are ready to render the
entire document. The button directly to the left of that button, which looks
like an upward-pointing arrow over a rectangle, will execute all code that comes
before this chunk in the document. This can be very helpful in making sure that
you have set up your environment to run this particular chunk of code.</p>

<p>The details and resources that we have covered so far focus on the basics of
RMarkdown. You can get a lot done just with these basics. However, the RMarkdown
system is very rich and allows complex functionality beyond these basics. In
this subsection, we will highlight just a few of the ways RMarkdown can be used
in a more advanced way. Since this topic is so broad, we will focus on elements
that we have found to be particularly useful for biomedical researchers as they
become more advanced RMarkdown users. For the most part, we will not go into
extensive detail about how to use these more advanced features in this module,
but instead point to resources where you can learn more as you are ready. If you
are just learning RMarkdown, at this point it will be helpful to just know that
some of these advanced features are available, so you can come back and explore
them when you become familiar with the basics. However, we will provide more
details for one advanced element that we find particularly useful in creating data
pre-processing protocols: including bibliographical references.</p>
<div id="including-bibliographical-references" class="section level3" number="19.5.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">19.5.1</span> Including bibliographical references<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#including-bibliographical-references"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>To include references in RMarkdown documents, you can use something called
<em>BibTeX</em>. This is a software system that is free and open-source and works in
concert with LaTeX and other markup languages. It allows you to save bibliographical information in a plain
text file—following certain rules—and then reference that information in a
document. In this way, it can serve the role of a bibliographical reference
manager (like Endnote or Mendeley) while being free and keeping all information
in plain text files, where they can easily be tracked with version control like
Git. By using BibTeX with RMarkdown, you can include bibliographical references
in the documents that you create, and RMarkdown will handle the creation of the
references section and the numbering of the documents within your text.</p>
<p>To use BibTeX to add references to an RMarkdown document, you’ll need to take
three steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a plain text file with listings for each of
your references (<em>BibTeX file</em>). Save this file with the
extension <code>.bib</code>. These listings need to follow a special format, which
we’ll describe in just a minute.</li>
<li>In your RMarkdown document, include the filepath
to this BibTeX file, so that RMarkdown will be able to find the bibliographical
listings.</li>
<li>In the text of the RMarkdown file, include a key and special character
combination anytime you want to reference a paper. This referencing also
follows a special format, which we’ll describe below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at each of these steps in a bit more detail. The first step is
to create a plain text file with a listing for each of the documents that
you’d like to cite. The plain text document should be saved with the file
extension <code>.bib</code> (for example, “mybibliography.bib”), and the listings for
each document in the file must follow specific rules.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at one to explore these rules. Here’s an example of a BibTeX
listing for a scientific article:</p>
<pre><code>@article{fox2020,
  title={Cyto-feature engineering: A pipeline for flow cytometry 
    analysis to uncover immune populations and associations with 
    disease},
  author={Fox, Amy and Dutt, Taru S and Karger, Burton and Rojas, 
    Mauricio and Obreg{\'o}n-Henao, Andr{\'e}s and 
    Anderson, G Brooke and Henao-Tamayo, Marcela},
  journal={Scientific Reports},
  volume={10},
  number={1},
  pages={1--12},
  year={2020}
}</code></pre>
<p>You can see that this listing is for an article, because it starts with the
keyword <code>@article</code>. BibTeX can record a number of different types of documents,
including articles, books, and websites. You start by specifying the document
type because different types of documents need to include different elements
in their listings. For example, a website should include the date when it was
last accessed, while an article typically will not.</p>
<p>Within the curly brackets for the listing shown above, there are key-value
pairs—elements where the type of value is given with a keyword (e.g.,
<code>title</code>), and then the value for that element is given after an equals sign.
For example, to specify the journal in which the article was published, this
listing has <code>journal={Scientific Reports}</code>. Finally, the listing has a key
that you will use to identify the listing in the main text. In this case,
the listing is given the key <code>fox2020</code>, which combines the first author and
publication year. You can use any keys you like for the items in the bibliography,
as long as they are different for every listing, so that the computer can
identify which bibliographical listing you are referring to when you use a key.</p>
<p>This format may seem overwhelming, but fortunately you will rarely have to
create these listings by hand. Instead, you can get them directly from Google
Scholar. To do this, look up the paper on Google Scholar (Figure
<a href="module19.html#fig:googlebibtex">19.6</a>). When you see it, look for a small quotation mark
symbol at the bottom of the article listing (shown with the top red arrow in
Figure <a href="module19.html#fig:googlebibtex">19.6</a>). If you click on this, it will open a pop-up
with the citation for the article. At the bottom of that pop-up is a link that
says “BibTeX” (bottom red arrow in Figure <a href="module19.html#fig:googlebibtex">19.6</a>). If you click
on that, it will take you to a page that gives the full BibTex listing for that
article, and you can just copy and paste this into your plain text BibTeX file.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:googlebibtex"></span>
<img src="figures/google_scholar.png" alt="Example of using Google Scholar to get bibliographical information for a BibTeX file. When you look up an article on Google Scholar, there is an option (the quotation mark icon under the article listing) to open a pop-up window with bibliographical information. At the bottom of this pop-up box, you can click on 'BibTeX' to get a plain text version of the BibTeX entry for the article. You can copy and paste this into you BibTeX file." width="100%"><p class="caption">

At the bottom of this pop-up box, you can click on ‘BibTeX’ to get a plain text version of the BibTeX entry for the article. You can copy and paste this into you BibTeX file.
</p>
</div>
<p>Once you have this plain text BibTeX file, you will tell your computer how to
find it by including its path in the YAML. For example, if you created a BibTeX
file called “mybibliography.tex” and saved it in the same directory as a
RMarkdown document, you could use the following to indicate this file for
the RMarkdown document:</p>
<pre><code>  ---
  title: "Reproducible Research with R"
  author: "Brooke Anderson"
  date: "1/25/2021"
  output: beamer_presentation
  bibliography: mybibliography.bib
  ---</code></pre>
<p>This shows the YAML for the document—the part that goes at the beginning of
the RMarkdown document and gives some metadata and overall instructions for the
document. In this example, we’ve added an extra line: <code>bibliography: mybibliography.bib</code>. This says that you’d like to link to a BibTeX file when
this document is rendered, as well as where to find that file (the file named
“mybibliography.bib” in the directory of the RMarkdown file).</p>
<p>Now that you have created the BibTeX file and told the RMarkdown file where to
find it, you can connect the two. As you write in the RMarkdown file, you can
refer to any of your BibTeX listings by using the key that you set for that
document. For example, if you wanted to reference the Fox et al. paper we
used in the example listing above, you would use the key that we set for
that listing, <code>fox2020</code>.
You will follow a special convention when you reference this key: you’ll use the
<code>@</code> symbol directly followed by that key. Typically, you will surround
this with square brackets. Therefore, to reference the Fox et al. paper,
you’d use <code>[@fox2021]</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s how that might look in practice. If you write in the RMarkdown document:</p>
<pre><code>This technique follows earlier work [@fox2020].</code></pre>
<p>In the output from rendering that RMarkdown document you’d get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>``This technique follows earlier work (Fox et al. 2020).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The full paper details will then be included at the end of the document, in a reference
section.</p>

</h3>
<p>There are a number of other advanced things that you can do with RMarkdown, once
you have mastered the basics. First, you can use RMarkdown to build different
types of documents, not just reports in Word, PDF, or HTML. For example, you can
use the <code>bookdown</code> package to create entire online and print books using the
RMarkdown framework. This book of modules was created using this system.
You can also create websites and web dashboards, using the <code>blogdown</code> and
<code>flexdashboard</code> packages, repectively. The <code>blogdown</code> package allows you to
create professionally-styled websites, including blog sections where you can
include R code and results. Figure <a href="module19.html#fig:blogdown">19.7</a> gives an example of a
website created using <code>blogdown</code>—you can see the full website
<a href="https://kind-neumann-789611.netlify.app/">here</a> if you’d like to check out some
of the features that this framework provides. The <code>flexdashboard</code> package lets
you create “dashboards” with data, similar to the dashboards that many public
health departments using during the COVID-19 pandemic to share case numbers in
specific counties and states.</p>

Figure 19.7: Example of a website created using blogdown, leveraging the RMarkdown framework.
</p>
</div>
<p>With RMarkdown, you can also create reports that are more customized than the
default style that we explored above. First, you can create templates that add
customized styling to the document. In fact, many journals have created
journal-specific templates that you can use in RMarkdown. With these templates,
you can write up your research results in a reproducible way, using RMarkdown,
and submit the resulting document directly to the journal, in the correct
format. An example of the first page of an article created in RMarkdown using
one of these article templates is shown in Figure <a href="module19.html#fig:rticleexample">19.8</a>.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Wendt and Anderson, &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Finding and Selecting r Packages.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>338</sup></a></span> The <code>rticles</code> package in R provides these templates for several
different journal families.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>RMarkdown also has some features that make it easy to run code that is
computationally expensive or code that is written in another programming
language. If code takes a long time to run, there are options in RMarkdown to
<em>cache</em> the results—that is, run the code once when you render the document,
and then only re-run it in later renderings if the inputs have changed. RMarkdown
does this through by saving intermediate results, as well as using a system to
remember which pieces of code depend on which earlier code. With very computationally
expensive code, it can be a big time saver, although it can also use more storage,
since it is saving more results. To include code in languages other than R, you can
change something called the <em>engine</em> of the code chunk. Essentially, this is the
language that your computer will use to run the code in that chunk. You can change
the engine so that certain chunks of code are run using Python, Julia, and other
languages by specifying the engine you’d like to use in the marker in the document
that indicates the start of a piece of executable code. Earlier in this module,
we showed you that executable code is normally introduced in RMarkdown with
<code>```{r}</code>. The <code>r</code> in this string is specifying that the R engine should be
used to run the code.</p>
<p>Finally, RMarkdown allows you to create very customized formatting, as you move into
more advanced ways to use the framework.
As mentioned earlier, Markdown is a fairly simple markup language. Occasionally,
this simplicity means that you might not be able to create fancier formatting
that you might desire. There is a method that allows you to work around this
constraint in RMarkdown.</p>
<p>In RMarkdown documents, when you need more complex formatting, you can shift
into a more complex markup language for part of the document. Markup languages
like LaTeX and HTML are much more expressive than Markdown, with many more
formatting choices possible. However,
there is a downside—when you include formatting specified in these
more complex markup languages, you will limit the output formats that you can
render the document to. For example, if you include LaTeX formatting within
an RMarkdown document, you must output the document to PDF, while if you
include HTML, you must output to an HTML file. Conversely, if you stick with
the simpler formatting available through the Markdown syntax, you can easily
switch the output format for your document among several choices.</p>
<p>One area of customization that is particularly useful and simple to implement is
with customized tables. The Markdown syntax can create very simple tables, but
does not allow the creation of more complex tables. There is an R package called
<code>kableExtra</code> that allows you to create very attractive and complex tables
in RMarkdown documents.
This package leverages more of the power of underlying markup languages, rather
than the simpler Markdown language.
The
<code>kableExtra</code> package is extensively documented through two vignettes that come
with the package, one if the output will be in pdf
(<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf</a>)

<p>To learn more about RMarkdown, you can explore a number of excellent resources.
The most comprehensive are shared by Posit, where RMarkdown’s developer
and maintainer, Yihui Xie, works. These resources are all freely available
online, and some are also available to buy as print books, if you prefer that
format.</p>
<p>First, you should check out the online tutorials that are provided by Posit on
RMarkdown. These are available at Posit’s RMarkdown page:
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/</a>. The page’s “Getting Started” section
(<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html</a>) provides a nice introduction you
can work through to try out RMarkdown and practice the overview provided in the
last subsection of this module. The “Articles” section
(<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles.html" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles.html</a>) provides a number of other
documents to help you learn RMarkdown. Posit’s RMarkdown page also includes a
“Gallery” (<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html</a>). This resource allows you
to browse through example documents, so you can get a visual idea of what you
might want to create and then access the example code for a similar document.
This is a great resource for exploring the variety of documents that you can
create using RMarkdown.</p>
<p>To go more deeply into RMarkdown, there are two online books from some of the
same team that are available online. The first is <em>R Markdown: The Definitive
Guide</em> by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund, &lt;em&gt;R Markdown&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>339</sup></a></span> This book is
available free online at <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/</a>. It moves from
basics through very advanced functionality that you can implement with
RMarkdown, including several of the topics we highlight later in this
subsection.</p>
<p>The second online book to explore from this team is <em>R Markdown Cookbook</em>, by
Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, and Emily Riederer.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, and Emily Riederer, &lt;em&gt;R Markdown Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; (Chapman; Hall/CRC, 2020).&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>340</sup></a></span> This book is available
free online at <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/</a>. This book is a
helpful resource for dipping in to a specific section when you want to learn how
to achieve a specific task. Just like a regular cookbook has recipes that you
can explore and use one at a time, this book does not require a comprehensive
end-to-end read, but instead provides “recipes” with advice and instructions for
doing specific things. For example, if you want to figure out how to align a
figure that you create in the center of the page, rather than the left, you can
find a “recipe” in this book to do that.</p>
