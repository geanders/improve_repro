<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.11</span> Enhance the reproducibility of collaborative research with version control platforms</h2>
<p>Once a researcher has learned to use <em>git</em> on their own computer for
local version control, they can begin using version control platforms (e.g.,
<em>GitLab</em>, <em>GitHub</em>) to collaborate with others under version
control. We will describe how a research team can benefit from using a version
control platform to work collaboratively.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List benefits of using a version control platform to collaborate
on research projects, particularly for reproducibility</li>
<li>Describe the difference between version control (e.g., <em>git</em>) and
a version control platform (e.g., <em>GitLab</em>)</li>
</ul>
<div id="what-are-version-control-platforms" class="section level3" number="2.11.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.11.1</span> What are version control platforms?</h3>
<p>The last module introduced the idea of version control, including the
popular software tool often used for version control, <em>git</em>. In this
module, we’ll go a step further, telling you about how you can expand
the idea of version control to leverage it when collaborating across
your research team, using <strong>version control platforms</strong>.</p>
<p>When research groups—or any other professional teams—collaborate on
publications and research, the process can be a bit haphazard. Teams often use
emails and email attachments to share updates on the project, and email
attachments to pass around the latest version of a document for others to review
and edit. For example, one group of researchers investigated a large collection
of emails from Enron <span class="citation">(Hermans and Murphy-Hill 2015)</span>. They found that passing Excel files
through email attachements was a common practice, and that messages within
emails suggested that spreadsheets were stored locally, rather than in a
location that was accessible to all team members <span class="citation">(Hermans and Murphy-Hill 2015)</span>, which
meant that team members might often be working on different versions of the same
spreadsheet file. They note that “the practice of emailing spreadsheets is known
to result in serious problems in terms of accountability and errors, as people
do not have access to the latest version of a spreadsheet, but need to be
updated of changes via email.” <span class="citation">(Hermans and Murphy-Hill 2015)</span> The same process for
collaboration is often used in scientific research, as well: one study found,
“Team members regularly pass data files back and forth by hand, by email, and by
using shared lab or project servers, websites, and databases.”
<span class="citation">(Edwards et al. 2011)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The most primitive (but still very common) method [of version control] is all
hand-hacking. You snapshot the project periodically by manually copying
everything in it to a backup. You include history comments in source files. You
make verbal or email arrangements with other developers to keep their hands off
certain files while you hack them. … The hidden costs of this hand-hacking
method are high, especially when (as frequently happens) it breaks down. The
procedures take time and concentration; they’re prone to error, and tend to get
slipped under pressure or when the project is in trouble—that is exactly when
they are needed.” <span class="citation">(E. S. Raymond 2003)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These practices make it very difficult to keep track of all project files,
and in particular, to track which version of each file is the most current.
Further, this process constrains patterns of collaboration—it requires
each team member to take turns in editing each file, or for one team member
to attempt to merge in changes that were made by separate team members at
the same time when all versions are collected. Further, this process makes
it difficult to keep track of why changes were made, and often requires
one team member to approve the changes of other team members. While the
“Track changes” and comment features can help the team communicate with
each other, but these features often lead to a very messy document at
stages in the editing, where it is hard to pick out the current versus
suggested wording, and once a change is accepted or a comment deleted,
these conversations are typically lost forever. Finally, word processing
tools are poorly suited to track changes or add suggestions directly to
data or code, as both data and code are usually saved in formats that
aren’t native to word processing programs, and copying them into a format
like Word can introduce problematic hidden formatting that can cause the
data or code to malfunction.</p>
<p>A version control platform allows you to share project files across a group of
collaborators while keeping track of what changes are made, who made each
change, and why each change was made. It therefore combines the strengths of a
“Track changes” feature with those of a file sharing platform like Dropbox. To
some extent, Google Docs or Google Drive also combine these features, and some
spreadsheet programs are moving toward some rudimentary functionality for
version control <span class="citation">(Birch, Lyford-Smith, and Guo 2018)</span>. However, there are added advantages of
version control platforms. Since open-source version control platforms like
GitHub can be set up on a server that you own, they can be used to collaborate
on projects with sensitive data, and also can store data directly on the server
you would like to use to store large project datasets or to run
computationally-intensive pre-processing or analysis. Finally, most version
control platforms include tools that help you manage and track the project.
These include “Issue Trackers,” tools for exploring the history of each file
and each change, and features to assign project tasks to specific team members.
The next section will describe the features of version control platforms that
make them helpful as a tool for collaborating on scientific research. These
systems are being leveraged by some scientists, both to manage research projects
and also to collaborate on writing scientific manuscripts and grant proposals
<span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Using GitHub or any similar versioning / tracking system is not a replacement
for good project management; it is an extension, an improvement for good
project and file management.” <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Version control platforms are always used in conjunction with version control
software, like the <em>git</em> software described in the last module. Version control
itself has been described as “a suite of programs that automates away most of
the drudgery involved in keeping an annotated history of your project and
avoiding modification conflicts,” <span class="citation">(E. S. Raymond 2003)</span>. The version control
platform leverages the history of commits that were made to the project, as well
as the version control software’s capabilities for merging changes made by
different people at different times. On top of these facilities, a version
control platform also adds attractive visual interfaces for working with the
project, free or low-cost online hosting of project files, and team management
tools for each project. You can think of <em>git</em> as the engine, in other words,
and the version control platform as the driver’s seat, with dashboard, steering
wheel, and gears to leverage the power of the underlying <em>git</em> software.</p>
<p>A number of version control platforms are available. Two that are currently very
popular for scientific research are GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/" class="uri">https://github.com/</a>) and GitLab
(<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" class="uri">https://about.gitlab.com/</a>). Both provide free options for scientific
researchers, including the capabilities for using both public and private
repositories in collaboration with other researchers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resources like GitHub are “essential for collaborative software projects
because they enable the organization and sharing of programming tasks between
different remote contributors.” <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="why-use-version-control-platforms" class="section level3" number="2.11.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.11.2</span> Why use version control platforms?</h3>
<p>Version control platforms offer a number of advantages when collaborating
on a research project that can help to improve your efficiency, rigor, and
reproducibility. Further, there are several high-quality free versions
of version control platforms that are available for researchers, and as
their use becomes more popular, resources for learning the details of how
to use these platforms effectively. Open-source versions, like GitLab,
even allow you to set up a version control platform on a server you own,
rather than needing to post data or code on an outside platform, and so
you can use these tools even in cases of sensitive data.</p>
<p>Some of the key advantages of using a version control platform like GitHub
to collaborate on research projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to track and merge changes that different collaborators made to the
document</li>
<li>Ability to create alternative versions of project files (<em>branches</em>), and merge them into the main project as desired</li>
<li>Tools for project management, including Issue Trackers</li>
<li>Default backup of project files</li>
<li>Ability to share project information online, including through hosting websites related to the project or supplemental files related to a manuscript</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these strengths draw directly on the functions provided by the
underlying version control software (e.g., <em>git</em>). However, the version control
platform will typically allow team members to explore and work with these
functions in an easier way than if they try to use the barebones version control
software. In earlier years, the use of version control often required users to
be familiar with the command line, and to send arcane commands to track the
project files through that interface. With the rising popularity of version
control platforms, version control for project management can be taught
relatively quickly to students with a few months—or even weeks—of coding
experience. In fact, version control is beginning to be used as a method of
turning in and grading homework in beginning programming classes, with students
learning these techniques in the first few weeks of class. This would be
practically unimaginable without the user-friendly interface of a version
control platform as a wrapper for the power of the version control software
itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One reason for GitHub’s success is that it offers more than a simple source
code hosting service. It provides developers and researchers with a dynamic and
collaborative environment, often referred to as a social coding platform, that
supports peer review, commenting, and discussion. A diverse range of efforts,
ranging from individual to large bioinformatics projects, laboratory
repositories, as well as global collaborations, have found GitHub to be a
productive place to share code and ideas and collaborate.” <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first strength of using version control—and a version control
platform—to collaborate on scientific projects is its ability to track every
change made to files in the project, why the change was made, and who made it.
Version control creates a full history of the evolution of each file in the
project. When a change is committed, the history records the exact change made,
including the previous version of the file. No change is ever fully lost,
therefore, unless a great deal of extra work is taken to erase something from
the project’s commit history. Version control also requires a user to provide a
<em>commit message</em> describing each change that is made. If this feature is used
thoughtfully, then the commit history of the project provides a well-documented
description of the project’s full evolution. If you’re working on a manuscript,
for example, when it’s time to edit, you can cut whole paragraphs, and if you
ever need to get them back, they’ll be right there in the commit history for
your project, with their own commit message about why they were cut (hopefully a
nice clear one that will make it easy to find that commit if you ever need those
paragraphs again).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Version control systems] are a huge boon to productivity and code quality in
many ways, even for small single-developer projects. They automate away many
procedures that are just tedious work. They help a lot in recovering from
mistakes. Perhaps most importantly, they free programmers to experiment by
guarnateeing that reversion to a known-good state will always be easy.”
<span class="citation">(E. S. Raymond 2003)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These capacities to track changes and histories of project files becomes even
more important when working in collaboration on a project. As the proverb about
too many cooks in the kitchen captures, any time you have multiple people
working on a project, it introduces the chance for conflicts. While higher-level
conflicts, like about what you want the final product to look like or who should
do which jobs, can’t be easily managed by a computer program, now the
complications of integrating everyone’s contributions—and letting people work
in their own space and then bring together their individual work into one final
joint project—can be. While these programs for version control were originally
created to help with programmers developing code, they can be used now to
coordinate group work on numerous types of file-based projects, including
scientific manuscripts, books, and websites <span class="citation">(E. Raymond 2009)</span>. And
although they can work with projects that include binary code, they thrive in
projects with a heavier concentration of text-based files, and so they fit in
nicely in a scientific research / data analysis workflow that is based on data
stored in plain text formats and data analysis scripts written in plain text
files, tools we discuss in other parts of this book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In a medium-sized project, it often happens that a (relatively small) number
of people work simultaneously on a single set of files, the ‘program’ or the
‘project.’ Often these people have additional tasks, causing their working
speeds to differ greatly. One person may be working a steady ten hours a day on
the project, a second may have barely time to dabble in the project enough to
keep current, while a third participant may be sent off on an urgent temporary
assignment just before finishing a modification. It would be nice if each
participant could be abstracted from the vicissitudes of the lives of the
others.” <span class="citation">(Grune 1986)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern version control systems like <em>git</em> take a distributed approach to
collaboration on project files. Under the distributed model, all team members
can have their own version of all the files, work on them and make records of
changes they make to the files, and then occassionally sync with everyone else
to share your changes with them and bring their changes into your copy of the
files. This functionality is called <em>concurrency</em>, since it allows team members
to concurrently work on the same set of files <span class="citation">(E. Raymond 2009)</span>. This idea
allowed for the development of other useful features and styles of working,
including <em>branching</em> to try out new ideas that you’re not sure you’ll
ultimately want to go with and <em>forking</em>, a key tool used in open-source
software development, which among other things facilitates someone who isn’t
part of the original team getting a copy of the files they can work with and
suggesting some changes that might be helpful. So, this is the basic idea of
modern version control—for a project that involves a set of computer files,
everyone on the team (even if that’s just one person) has their own copy of a
directory with those files on their own computer, makes changes at the time and
in the spots in the files that they want, and then regularly re-syncs their
local directory with everyone else’s to share changes and updates.</p>
<p>There is one key feature of modern version control that’s critical to making
this work—merging files that started the same but were edited in different
ways and now need to be put back together, bringing any changes made from the
original version. This step is called <em>merging</em> the files. While this is
typically described using the plural, “files,” at a higher-level, you can thing
of this as just merging the <em>changes</em> that two people have made as they edited a
single file, a file where they both started out with identical copies.</p>
<p>Think of the file broken up into each of its separate lines. There will be some
lines that neither person changed. Those are easy to handle in the
“merge”—they stay the same as in the original copy of the file. Next, there
will be some lines that one person changed, but that the other person didn’t. It
turns out that these are pretty easy to handle, too. If only one person changed
the line, then you use their version—it’s the most up-to-date, since if both
people started out with the same version, it means that the other person didn’t
make any changes to that part of the file. Finally, there may be a few lines
that both people changed. These are called <em>merge conflicts</em>. They’re places in
the file where there’s not a clear, easy-to-automate way that the computer can
know which version to put into the integrated, latest version of the file.
Different version control programs handle these merge conflicts in different
ways. For the most common version control program used today, <em>git</em>, these spots
in the file are flagged with a special set of symbols when you try to integrate
the two updated versions of the file. Along with the special symbols to denote a
conflict, there will also be <em>both</em> versions of the conflicting lines of the
file. Whoever is integrating the files must go in and pick the version of those
lines to use in the integrated version of the file, or write in some compromise
version of those lines that brings in elements from both people’s changes, and
then delete all the symbols denoting that was a conflict and save this latest
version of the file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You will likely share your code with multiple lab mates or collaborators,
and they may have suggestions on how to improve it. If you email the code
to multiple people, you will have to manually incorporate all the changes
each of them sends.” <span class="citation">(Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a number of other features of version control that make it useful for
collaborating on file-based projects with teams. First, these systems allow you
to explain your changes as you make them—in other words, it allows for
<em>annotation</em> of the developing and editing process <span class="citation">(E. Raymond 2009)</span>. This
provides the team with a full history of why the files evolved in the way they
did across the team. It also provides a way to communicate across the team
members.</p>
<p>For example, if one person is the key person working on a certain file,
but has run into a problem with one spot and asks another team member to take a
go, then the second team member isn’t limited to just looking at the file and
then emailing some suggestions. Instead, the second person can make sure he or
she has the latest version of that file, make the changes they think will help,
<em>commit</em> those changes with a message (a <em>commit message</em>) about why they think
this change will fix the problem, and then push that latest version of the file
back to the first person. If there are several places where it would help to
change the file, then these can be fixed through several separate commits, each
with their own message. The first person, who originally asked for help, can
read through the updates in the file (most platforms for using version control
will now highlight where all these changes are in the file) and read the second
person’s message or messages about why each change might help. Even better, days
or months later, when team members are trying to figure out why a certain change
was made in that part of the file, can go back and read these messages to get an
explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You know your code has changed; do you know why? It’s easy to forget the
reasons for changes, and step on them later. If you have collaborators on a
project, how do you know what they have changed while you weren’t looking, and
who was responsible for each change?” <span class="citation">(E. S. Raymond 2003)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In recent years, some complementary tools have been developed that make the
process of collaborating together using version control software easier. Other
tools can helps in collaborating on file-based projects, including <em>bug
trackers</em> or <em>issue trackers</em>, which allow the team to keep a running “to-do”
list of what needs to be done to complete the project, all of which are
discussed in the next chapter <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<!-- > "GitHub issues are a great way to keep track of bugs, tasks, feature requests, -->
<!-- and enhancements. While classical issue trackers are primarily intended to be  -->
<!-- used as bug trackers, in contrast, GitHub issue trackers follow a different  -->
<!-- philosophy: each tracker has its own section in every repository and can be used -->
<!-- to trace bugs, new ideas, and enhancements by using a powerful tagging system. -->
<!-- The main objective of issues in GitHub is promoting collaboration and providing  -->
<!-- context using cross-references. Raising an issue does not require lengthy forms -->
<!-- to be completed. It only requires a title and, preferably, at least a short description. -->
<!-- Issues have very clear formatting and provide space for anyone with a GitHub account -->
<!-- to provide feedback. ... Additional elements of issues are (i) color-coded labels -->
<!-- that help to categorize and filter issues, (ii) milestones, and (iii) one assignee  -->
<!-- responsible for working on the issue." [@perez2016ten] -->
<!-- > "As another illustration of issues and their generic and wide application, we -->
<!-- and others used GitHub issues to discuss and comment on changes in manuscripts -->
<!-- and address reviewers' comments." [@perez2016ten] -->
<p>Finally, version control platforms like GitHub can be used for a number
of supplementary tasks for your research project. These include publishing
webpages or other web resources linked to the project and otherwise improving
public engagement with the project, including by allowing other researchers
to copy and adapt your project through a process called <em>forking</em>. Version
control platforms also provide a supplemental backup to project files.</p>
<p>First, GitHub can be used to collaborate on, host, and publish websites and
other online content <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>. Version control systems have been used by
some for a long time to help in writing longform materials like books (e.g.,
<span class="citation">(E. S. Raymond 2003)</span>); new tools are making the process even easier. Thethe GitHub
Pages functionality, for example, is now being used to host a number of books
created in R using the <code>bookdown</code> package, including the online version of this
book. The <code>blogdown</code> package similarly can be used to create websites, either
for individual researchers, for research labs, or for specific projects or
collaborations. Further, if a project includes the creation of scientific
software, it can be used to share that software—as well as associated
documentation—in a format that is easy for others to work with. The platform
can also be used to share supplemental material for a manuscript, including the
code used for preprocessing and analyzing data. The most popular version control
platforms, GitHub and GitLab, both allow users to toggle projects between
“public” and “private” modes, which can be used to work privately on a
project prior to peer review and publication, and then switch to a public mode
after publication. This functionality will allow those who access the code to
see not only the final product, but also the history of the development of the
code and data for the project, providing more transparency in the development
process, but without jeopardizing the novelty of the research results prior to
publication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The traditional way to promote scientific software is by publishing an
associated paper in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, though, as pointed
out by Buckheir and Donoho, this is just advertising. Additional steps can boost
the visibility of an organization. For example, GitHub Pages are simple websites
freely hosted by GitHub. Users can create and host blog websites, help pages,
manuals, tutorials, and websites related to specific projects.” <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With GitHub, while only collaborators on a public project can directly change
the code, anyone else can <em>suggest</em> changes through a process of copying a
version of the project (<em>forking</em> it). This allows someone to make the changes
they would like to suggest directly to a copy of the code, and then ask the
project’s owners to consider integrating the changes back into the main version
of the project through a <em>pull request</em>. GitHub therefore creates a platform
where people can explore, adapt, and add to other people’s coding projects,
enabling a community of coders <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>, and because of this
functionality it has been described as “a social network for software
development” <span class="citation">(J. Perkel 2018)</span> and as “a kind of bazaar that offers just about
any piece of code you might want—and so much of it free.” <span class="citation">(Metz 2015)</span>.
This same process can be leveraged for others to copy and adapt code—this is
particularly helpful in ensuring that a software or research project won’t be
“orphaned” if its main developer is unavailable (e.g., retires, dies), but
instead can be picked up and continued by other interested researchers.
Copyright statements and licenses within code projects help to clarify
attribution and rights in these cases.</p>

<p>“The astonishment was that you might want to make even your tiny hacks to
other people’s code public. Before GitHub, we tended to keep those on our own
computer. Nowadays, it is so each to make a fork, or even edit the code directly
in your browser, that potentially anyone can find even your least polished
bug fixes immediately.” <span class="citation">(Irving 2011)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, version control platforms help in providing additional back-up for
project files. As you collaborate with others using version control under
a distributed model, each collaborator will have their own copy of all
project files on their local computer. All project files are also
stored on the remote repository to which you all push and pull commits. If you
are using the GitHub platform, this will be GitHub’s servers; if you use
GitLab, you can set up the system on your own server. Each time you push
or pull from the remote copy of the project repository, you are syncing your
copy of the project files with those on other computers.</p>

<p>“Backup, backup, backup—this is the main action you can take to care for your
computers and your data. Many PIs assume that backup systems are inherently
permanent and foolproof, and it often takes a loss to remind one that
materials break, systems fail, and humans make mistakes. Even if your data
are backed up at work, have at least one other backup system. Keep at least
one backup off site, in case of a diaster in the lab (yes, fires and floods
do happen). It doesn’t make much sense to have two separate backup systems stored
next to each other in a drawer.” <span class="citation">(LEIPS 2010)</span></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.11.3</span> How to use GitHub</h3>
<p>In the next module, we describe practical ways to leverage these resources
within your research group. We include instructions both for team leaders—who
may not code but may want to use GitHub within projects to help manage the
projects—as well as researchers who work directly with data and code for the
research team. There are also a number of excellent resources that are now
available that walk users through how to set up and use a version control
platform. The process is particularly straightforward when the research project
files are collected in an RStudio Project format, as described in earlier
modules.</p>
