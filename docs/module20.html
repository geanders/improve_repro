</h1>
<p>We will walk through an example of creating a reproducible data pre-processing
protocol. As an example, we will look at how to pre-process and analyze data
that are collected in the laboratory to estimate bacterial load in samples.
These data come from plating samples from an immunological experiment at serial
dilutions, using data from an experiment lead by one of the coauthors. This data
pre-processing protocol was created using RMarkdown and allows the efficient,
transparent, and reproducible pre-processing of plating data for all experiments
in the research group. We will go through how RMarkdown techniques can be
applied to develop this type of data pre-processing protocol for a laboratory
research group.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain how a reproducible data pre-processing protocol can be developed for
a real research project</li>
<li>Understand how to design and implement a data pre-processing protocol to
replace manual or point-and-click data pre-processing tools</li>
<li>Apply techniques in RMarkdown to develop your own reproducible data
pre-processing protocols</li>

</h2>
<p>In this module, we’ll provide advice and an example of how you can use the
tools for knitted documents to create a reproducible data pre-processing
protocol. This module builds on ideas and techniques that were introduced
in the last two modules (modules <a href="module18.html#module18">18</a> and <a href="module19.html#module19">19</a>), to help you put them into practical use for
data pre-processing that you do repeatedly for research data in your
laboratory.</p>
<p>In this module, we will use an example of a common pre-processing task in
immunological research: estimating the bacterial load in samples by plating at
different dilutions. For this type of experiment, the laboratory researcher
plates each of the samples at several dillutions, identifies a good dilution for
counting colony-forming units (CFUs), and then back-calculates the estimated
bacterial load in the original sample based on the colonies counted at this “good”
dilution. This experimental technique dates back to the late 1800s, with Robert
Koch, and continues to be widely used in microbiology research and applications
today.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Avishai Ben-David and Charles E Davidson, &lt;span&gt;“Estimation Method for Serial Dilution Experiments,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Journal of Microbiological Methods&lt;/em&gt; 107 (2014): 214–21.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>341</sup></a></span> These data are originally from an experiment in one
of our authors’ laboratory and are also available as example data for an R
package called <code>bactcountr</code>, currently under development at
<a href="https://github.com/aef1004/bactcountr/tree/master/data" class="uri">https://github.com/aef1004/bactcountr/tree/master/data</a>.</p>
<p>These data are representative of data often collected in immunological research.
For example, you may be testing out some drugs against an infectious bacteria
and want to know how successful different drugs are in limiting bacterial load.
You run an experiment and have samples from animals treated with different drugs
or under control and would then want to know how much viable (i.e., replicating)
bacteria are in each of your samples.</p>
<p>You can find out by plating the sample at different dilutions and
counting the colony-forming units (CFUs) that are cultured on each plate.
You put a sample on a plate with a medium they can grow on and then give them
time to grow. The idea is that individual bacteria from the original sample end
up randomly around the surface of the plate, and any that are viable (able to
reproduce) will form a new colony that, after a while, you’ll be able to see.</p>
<p>To get a good estimate of bactieral load from this process, you need to count
CFUs on a “countable” plate—one with a “just right” dilution (and you
typically won’t know which dilution this is for a sample until after plating).
If you have too high of a dilution (i.e., one with very few viable bacteria),
randomness will play a big role in the CFU count, and you’ll estimate the
original bacterial load with more variability. If you have too low of a dilution (i.e., one
with lots of viable bacteria), it will be difficult to identify separate
colonies, and they may complete for resources. To translate from diluted
concentration to original concentration, you can then do a back-calculation,
incorporating both the number of colonies counted at that dilution and how
dilute the sample was. There is therefore some pre-processing required (although
it is fairly simple) to prepare the data collected to get an estimate of
bacterial load in the original sample. This estimate of bacterial load can then be used in
statistical testing and combined with other experimental data to explore
questions like whether a candidate vaccine reduces bacterial load when a research
animal is challenged with a pathogen.</p>
<p>We will use this example of a common data pre-processing task to show how to
create a reproducible pre-processing protocol in this module. If you would like,
you can access all the components of the example pre-processing protocol and
follow along, re-rendering it yourself on your own computer. The example data
are available as a csv file, downloadable
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geanders/improve_repro/master/data/bactcountr_example_data/cfu_data.csv">here</a>.
You can open this file using spreadsheet software, or look at it directly in
RStudio. The final pre-processing protocol for these data can also be
downloaded, including both <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geanders/improve_repro/master/data/bactcountr_example_data/example_protocol.Rmd">the original RMarkdown
file</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/geanders/improve_repro/raw/master/data/bactcountr_example_data/example_protocol.pdf">the output PDF
document</a>.
Throughout this module, we will walk through elements of this document, to
provide an example as we explain the process of developing data pre-processing
modules for common tasks in your research group. We recommend that you go ahead and
read through the output PDF document, to get an idea for the example protocol that
we’re creating.</p>
<p>This example is intentionally simple, to allow a basic introduction to the
process using pre-processing tasks that are familiar to many laboratory-based
scientists and easy to explain to anyone who has not used plating in experimental
work. However, the same general process can also be used to create
pre-processing protocols for data that are much larger or more complex or for
pre-processing pipelines that are much more involved.
For example, this process could be used to create data pre-processing protocols
for automated gating of flow cytometry data or for pre-processing data
collected through single cell RNA sequencing.</p>

</h2>
<p>Before you write your protocol in a knitted document, you should decide on the
content to include in the protocol. This section provides tips on this design
process. In this section, we’ll describe some key steps in designing a
data pre-processing protocol:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Defining input and output data for the protocol;</li>
<li>Setting up a project directory for the protocol;</li>
<li>Outlining key tasks in pre-processing the input data; and</li>
<li>Adding code for pre-processing.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will illustrate these design steps using the example protocol on
pre-processing plating data.</p>
<div id="defining-input-and-output-data-for-the-protocol" class="section level3" number="20.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">20.2.1</span> Defining input and output data for the protocol<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#defining-input-and-output-data-for-the-protocol"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The first step in designing the data pre-processing protocol is to decide on the
starting point for the protocol (the data input) and the ending point (the data
output). It may make sense to design a separate protocol for each major type of
data that you collect in your research laboratory. Your input data for the
protocol, under this design, might be the data that is output from a specific
type of equipment (e.g., flow cytometer) or from a certain type of sample or
measurement (e.g., metabolomics run on a mass spectrometer), even if it is a
fairly simple type of data (e.g., CFUs from plating data, as used in the example
protocol for this module). For example, say you are working with three types of
data for a research experiment: data from a flow cytometer, metabolomics data
measured with a mass spectrometer, and bacterial load data measured by plating
data and counting colony forming units (CFUs). In this case, you may want to
create three pre-processing protocols: one for the flow data, one for the
metabolomics data, and one for the CFU data. These protocols are modular and can
be re-used with other experiments that use any of these three types of data.</p>
<p>With an example dataset, you can begin to create a pre-processing protocol
before you collect any of your own research data for a new experiment. If the
format of the initial data is similar to the format you anticipate for your
data, you can create the code and explanations for key steps in your
pre-processing for that type of data. Often, you will be able to adapt the
RMarkdown document to change it from inputting the example data to inputting
your own experimental data with minimal complications, once your data comes in.
By thinking through and researching data pre-processing options before the data
is collected, you can save time in analyzing and presenting your project results
once you’ve completed the experimental data collection for the project. Further,
with an example dataset, you can get a good approximation of the format in which
you will output data from the pre-processing steps. This will allow you to begin
planning the analysis and visualization that you will use to combine the
different types of data from your experiment and use it to investigate important
research hypotheses. Again, if data follow standardized formats across steps in
your process, it will often be easy to adapt the code in the protocol to input
the new dataset that you created, without major changes to the code developed
with the example dataset.</p>
<p>While pre-processing protocols for some types of data might be very complex,
others might be fairly simple. However, it is still worthwhile to develop a
protocol even for simple pre-processing tasks, as it allows you to pass along
some of the details of pre-processing the data that might have become “common
sense” to longer-tenured members of your research group. For example, the
pre-processing tasks in the example protocol are fairly simple. This protocol
inputs data collected in a plain-text delimited file (a csv file, in the
example). Within the protocol, there are steps to convert initial measurements
from plating at different dilutions into an estimate of the bacterial load in
each sample. There are also sections in the protocol for exploratory data
analysis, to allow for quality assessment and control of the collected data as
part of the pre-processing. The output of the protocol is a simple data object (a
dataframe, in this example) with the bacterial load for each original sample.
These data are now ready to be used in tables and figures in the research report
or manuscript, as well as to explore associations with the experimental design
details (e.g., comparing bacterial load in treated versus untreated animals) or
merged with other types of experimental data (e.g., comparing immune cell
populations, as measured with flow cytometry data, with bacterial loads, as
measured from plating and counting CFUs).</p>
<p>Once you have identified the input data type to use for the protocol, you should
identify an example dataset from your laboratory that you can use to create the
protocol. This could be a dataset that you currently need to pre-process, in
which case the development of the protocol will serve a second purpose, allowing
you to complete this task at the same time. However, you may not have a new set
of data of this type that you currently need to pre-process, and in this case
you can build your protocol using a dataset from a previous experiment in your
laboratory. In this case, you may already have a record of the steps that you
used to pre-process the data previously, and these can be helpful as a starting
point as you draft the more thorough pre-processing protocol. You may want to
select an example dataset that you have already published or are getting ready
to publish, so you won’t feel awkard about making the data available for people
to practice with. If you don’t have an example dataset from your own laboratory,
you can explore example datasets that are already available, either as data
included with existing R packages or through open repositories, including those
hosted through national research institutions like the NIH. In this case, be
sure to cite the source of the data and include any available information about
the equipment that was used to collect it, including equipment settings used
when the data were collected.</p>
<p>For the example protocol for this module, we want to pre-process data that were
collected “by hand” by counting CFUs on plates in the laboratory. These counts
were recorded in a plain text delimited file (a csv file) using spreadsheet
software. The spreadsheet was set up to ensure the data can easily be converted
to a “tidy” format, as described in module <a href="module3.html#module3">3</a>. The first few rows of the input
data look like this:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 6
##   group replicate dilution_0 dilution_1 dilution_2 dilution_3
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     2 2-A       26         10                  0          0
## 2     2 2-B       TNTC       52                 10          5
## 3     2 2-C       0          0                   0          0
## 4     3 3-A       0          0                   0          0
## 5     3 3-B       TNTC       TNTC               30         10
## 6     3 3-C       0          0                   0          0</code></pre>
<p>Each row represents the number of bacterial colonies counted after plating a
certain sample, where each sample represents one experimental animal and several
experimental animals (replicates) were considered for each experimental group.
Columns are included with values for the experimental group of the sample
(<code>group</code>), the specific ID of the sample within that experimental group
(<code>replicate</code>, e.g., <code>2-A</code> is mouse A in experimental group 2), and the
colony-forming units (CFUs) counted at each of several dilutions. If a cell has
the value “TNTC”, this indicates that CFUs were too numerous to count for that
sample at that dilution.</p>
<p>When you have identified the input data type you will use for the protocol,
as well as selected an example dataset of this type to use to create the
protocol, you can include a section in the protocol
that describes these input data, what file format they are in, and how they
can be read into R for pre-processing (Figure <a href="module20.html#fig:protocoldatainput">20.1</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>For the data output, it often makes sense to plan for data in a format that is
appropriate for data analysis and for merging with other types of data collected
from the experiment. The aim of pre-processing is to get the data from the
format in which they were collected into a format that is meaningful for
combining with other types of data from the experiment and using in statistical
hypothesis testing.</p>
<p>In the example pre-processing protocol, we ultimately
output a simple dataset, with one row for each of the original samples. The
first few rows of this output data are:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 3
##   group replicate cfu_in_organ
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     2 2-A                260
## 2     2 2-B               2500
## 3     2 2-C                  0
## 4     3 3-A                  0
## 5     3 3-B               7500
## 6     3 3-C                  0</code></pre>
<p>For each original sample, an estimate of the CFUs of <em>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</em> in the full spleen is given (<code>cfu_in_organ</code>). These data
can now be merged with other data collected about each animal in the experiment.
For example, they could be joined with data that provide measures of the
immune cell populations for each animal, to explore if certain immune
cells are associated with bacterial load. They could also be joined with
experimental information and then used in hypothesis testing. For example,
these data could be merged with a table that describes which groups were
controls versus which used a certain vaccine, and then a test could be
conducted exploring evidence that bacterial loads in animals given a

</h3>
<p>Once you have decided on the input and output data formats, you will next want
to set up a file directory for storing all the inputs needed in the protocol.
You can include the project files for the protocol in an RStudio Project (see
module <a href="module6.html#module6">6</a>) and post this either publicly or privately on GitHub (see modules
<a href="module9.html#module9">9</a>–<a href="module11.html#module11">11</a>). This creates a “packet” of everything that a reader needs to use to
recreate what you did—they can download the whole GitHub repository and will
have a nice project directory on their computer with everything they need to try
out the protocol.</p>
<p>Part of the design of the protocol involves deciding on the files that should be
included in this project directory. Figure <a href="module20.html#fig:protocolprojectfiles">20.2</a>
provides an example of the initial files included in the project directory for
the example protocol for this module. The left side of the figure shows the
files that are initially included, while the left side shows the files in the
project after the code in the protocol is run.</p>
<p>Generally, in the project directory you should include a file with the input
example data, in whatever file format you will usually collect this type of
data. You will also include an RMarkdown file where the protocol is written. If
you are planning to cite articles and other references, you can include a BibTeX
file, with the bibliographical information for each source you plan to cite (see module <a href="module19.html#module19">19</a>).
Finally, if you would like to include photographs or graphics, you can include
these image files in the project directory. Often, you might want to group these
together in a subdirectory of the project named something like “figures”.</p>
<p>Once you run the RMarkdown file for the protocol, you will generate additional
files in the project. Two typical files you will generate will be the output
file for the protocol (in the example, this is output to a pdf file). Usually,
the code in the protocol will also result in output data, which is pre-processed
through the protocol code and written into a file to be used in further
analysis.</p>

</h3>
<p>The next step is to outline the key tasks that are involved in moving from the
data input to the desired data output. For the plating data we are using for our
example, the key tasks to be included in the pre-processing protocol are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the data into R</li>
<li>Explore the data and perform some quality checks</li>
<li>Identify a “good” dilution for each sample—one at which you have a
countable plate</li>
<li>Estimate the bacterial load in each original sample based on the CFUs counted
at that dilution</li>
<li>Output data with the estimated bacterial load for each sample</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have this basic design, you can set up the RMarkdown file for the
pre-processing protocol to include a separate section for each task, as well as
an “Overview” section at the beginning to describe the overall protocol, the
data being pre-processed, and the laboratory procedures used to collect those
data. In RMarkdown, you can create first-level section headers by putting the
text for the header on its own line and beginning that line with <code>#</code>, followed
by a space. You should include a blank line before and after the line with this
header text. Figure <a href="module20.html#fig:protocolsections">20.3</a> shows how this is done in the
example protocol for this module, showing how text in the plain text RMarkdown
file for the protocol align with section headers in the final pdf output of the
protocol.</p>

</h3>
<p>For many of these steps, you likely have code—or can start drafting the
code—required for that step.
In RMarkdown, you can test this code as you write it. You insert each piece
of executable code within a special section, separated from the regular
text with special characters, as described in previous modules.</p>
<p>For any pre-processing steps that are straightforward (e.g., calculating the
dilution factor in the example module, which requires only simple mathematical
operations), you can directly write in the code required for the step.
For other pre-processing steps, however, the algorithm may be a bit more
complex. For example, complex algorithms have been developed for steps like
peak identification and alignment that are required when
pre-processing data from a mass spectrometer.</p>
<p>For these more complex tasks, you can start to explore available R packages for
performing the task. There are thousands of packages available that extend the
basic functionality of R, providing code implementations of algorithms in a
variety of scientific fields. Many of the R packages relevant for biological
data—especially high-throughput biological data—are available through a
repository called Bioconductor. These packages are all open-source (so you can
explore their code if you want to) and free. You can use vignettes and package
manuals for Bioconductor packages to identify the different functions you can
use for your pre-processing steps. Once you have identified a function for the
task, you can use the helpfile for the function to see how to use it. This help
documentation will allow you to determine all of the function’s parameters and
the choices you can select for each.</p>
<p>You can add each piece of code in the RMarkdown version of the protocol using
the standard method for RMarkdown (module <a href="module11.html#module11">11</a>). Figure <a href="module20.html#fig:protocolcode">20.4</a>
shows an example from the example protocol for this module. Here, we are using
code to help identify a “good” dilution for counting CFUs for each sample. The
code in included in an executable code chunk, and so it will be run each time
the protocol is rendered. Code comments are included in the code to provide
finer-level details about what the code is doing.</p>

</div>
<p>For each step of the protocol, you can also include potential problems
that might come up in specific instances of the data you get from
future experiments. This can help you adapt the code in the protocol in
thoughtful ways as you apply it in the future to new data collected
for new studies and projects.</p>

</h2>
<p>Now that you have planned out the key components of the pre-processing protocol,
you can use RMarkdown’s functionality to flesh it out into a full pre-processing
protocol. This gives you the chance to move beyond a simple code script, and
instead include more thorough descriptions of what you’re doing at each step and
why you’re doing it. You can also include discussions of potential limitations
of the approach that you are taking in the pre-processing, as well as areas
where other research groups might use a different approach. These details can
help when it is time to write the Methods section for the paper describing your
results from an experiment using these data. They can also help your research
group identify pre-processing choices that might differ from other research
groups, which opens the opportunity to perform sensitivity analyses regarding
these pre-processing choices and ensure that your final conclusions are robust
across multiple reasonable pre-processing approaches.</p>
<p>Protocols are common for wet lab techniques, where they provide a “recipe” that
ensures consistency and reproducibility in those processes. Computational tasks,
including data pre-processing, can also be standardized through the creation and
use of protocol in your research group. While code scripts are becoming more
common as a means of recording data pre-processing steps, they are often not
as clear as a traditional protocol, in particular in terms of providing a
thorough description of what is being done at each step and why it is being
done that way. Data pre-processing protocols can provide these more thorough
descriptions, and by creating them with RMarkdown or with similar types
of “knitted” documents (modules <a href="module18.html#module18">18</a> and <a href="module19.html#module19">19</a>), you can combine the executable code
used to pre-process the data with extensive documentation. As a further
advantage, the creation of these protocols will ensure that your research
group has thought carefully about each step of the process, rather than
relying on cobbling together bits and pieces of code they’ve found but don’t
fully understand. Just as the creation of a research protocol for a
clinical trial requires a careful consideration of each step of the ultimate
trial,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;AzzAm Al-JunDi and SAlAh SAkkA, &lt;span&gt;“Protocol Writing in Clinical Research,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Desearch: JCDR&lt;/em&gt; 10, no. 11 (2016): ZE10.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>342</sup></a></span> the creation of data pre-processing protocols ensure
that each step in the process is carefully considered, and so helps to
ensure that each step of this process is conducted as carefully as the
steps taken in designing the experiment as a whole and each wet lab technique
conducted for the experiment.</p>
<p>A data pre-processing protocol, in the sense we use it here, is essentially an
annotated recipe for each step in preparing your data from the initial, “raw”
state that is output from the laboratory equipment (or collected by hand) to a
state that is useful for answering important research questions. The exact
implementation of each step is given in code that can be re-used and adapted
with new data of a similar format. However, the code script is often not enough
to helpfully understand, share, and collaborate on the process. Instead, it’s
critical to also include descriptions written by humans and for humans. These
annotations can include descriptions of the code and how certain parameters are
standardized the algorithms in the code. They can also be used to justify
choices, and link them up both with characteristics of the data and equipment
for your experiment as well as with scientific principles that underlie the
choices. Protocols like this are critical to allow you to standardize the
process you use across many samples from one experiment, across different
experiments and projects in your research laboratory, and even across different
research laboratories.</p>
<p>As you begin adding text to your pre-processing protocol, you should keep in
mind these general aims. First, a good protocol provides adequate detail that
another researcher can fully reproduce the procedure.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>343</sup></a></span> For a
protocol for a trial or wet lab technique, this means that the protocol should
allow another researcher to reproduce the process and get results that are
<em>comparable</em> to your results;<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>344</sup></a></span> for a data pre-processing
protocol, the protocol must include adequate details that another researcher,
provided they start with the same data, gets <em>identical</em> results (short of any
pre-processing steps that include some element of sampling or random-number
generation, e.g., Monte Carlo methods). This idea—being able to exactly
re-create the computational results from an earlier project—is referred to as
<em>computational reproducibility</em> and is considered a key component in
ensuring that research is fully reproducible.</p>
<p>By creating the data pre-processing protocol as a knitted document
using a tool like RMarkdown (modules <a href="module18.html#module18">18</a> and <a href="module19.html#module19">19</a>), you can ensure that the protocol is
computationally reproducible. In an RMarkdown document, you include the code
examples as <em>executable</em> code—this means that the code is run every time you
render the document. You are therefore “checking” your code every time that you
run it. As the last step of your pre-processing protocol, you should output the
copy of the pre-processed data that you will use for any further analysis for
the project. You can use functions in R to output this to a plain text format,
for example a comma-separated delimited file (modules <a href="module4.html#module4">4</a> and <a href="module5.html#module5">5</a>). Each time you render
the protocol, you will re-write this output file, and so this provides assurance
that the code in your protocol can be used to reproduce your output data (since
that’s how you yourself created that form of the data).</p>
<p>Figure <a href="module20.html#fig:protocoloutput">20.5</a> provides an example from the example protocol
for this module. The RMarkdown file for the protocol includes code to write out
the final, pre-processed data to a comma-separated plain text file called
“processed_cfu_estimates.csv”. This code writes the output file into the same
directory where you’ve saved the RMarkdown file. Each time the RMarkdown file is
rendered to create the pdf version of the protocol, the input data will be
pre-processed from scratch, using the code throughout the protocol, and this
file will be overwritten with the data generated. This guarantees that the code
in the protocol can be used by anyone—you or other researchers—to reproduce
the final data from the protocol, and so guarantees that these data are
computationally reproducible.</p>

<p>In your data pre-processing protocol, show the code that you use to implement
this choice and also explain clearly in the text why you made this choice and
what alternatives should be considered if data characteristics are different.
Write this as if you are explaining to a new research group member (or your
future self) how to think about this step in the pre-processing, why you’re
doing it the way your doing it, and what code is used to do it that way. You
should also include references that justify choices when they are
available—include these using BibTeX (module <a href="module19.html#module19">19</a>). By doing this, you will make it much
easier on yourself when you write the Methods section of papers that report on
the data you have pre-processed, as you’ll already have draft information on
your pre-processing methods in your protocol.</p>
<p>Good protocols include not only <em>how</em> (for data pre-processing protocols, this
is the code), but also <em>why</em> each step is taken. This includes explanations that are both higher-level
(i.e., why a larger question is being asked) and also at a fine level, for each
step in the process. A protocol should include some background, the
aims of the work, hypotheses to be tested, materials and methods, methods of
data collection and equipment to analyze samples.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>345</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This step of documentation and explanation is very important to creating a
useful data pre-processing protocol. Yes, the code itself allows someone else to
replicate what you did. However, only those who are very, very familiar with the
software program, including any of the extension packages you include, can
“read” the code directly to understand what it’s doing. Further, even if you
understand the code very well when you create it, it is unlikely that you will
stay at that same level of comprehension in the future, as other tasks and
challenges take over that brain space. Explaining for humans, in text that
augments and accompanies the code, is also important because function names and
parameter names in code often are not easy to decipher. While excellent
programmers can sometimes create functions with clear and transparent names,
easy to translate to determine the task each is doing, this is difficult in
software development and is rare in practice. Human annotations, written by and
for humans, are critical to ensure that the steps will be clear to you and
others in the future when you revisit what was done with this data and what you
plan to do with future data.</p>
<p>The process of writing a protocol in this way forces you to think about each
step in the process, why you do it a certain way (include parameters you choose
for certain functions in a pipeline of code), and include justifications from
the literature for this reasoning. If done well, it should allow you to quickly
and thoroughly write the associated sections of Methods in research reports and
manuscripts and help you answer questions and challenges from reviewers. Writing
the protocol will also help you identify steps for which you are uncertain how
to proceed and what choices to make in customizing an analysis for your research
data. These are areas where you can search more deeply in the literature to
understand implications of certain choices and, if needed, contact the
researchers who developed and maintained associated software packages to get
advice.</p>
<p>For example, the example protocol for this module explains how to pre-process
data collected from counting CFUs after plating serial dilutions of samples. One
of the steps of pre-processing is to identify a dilution for each sample at
which you have a “countable” plate. The protocol includes an explanation of why
it is important to identify the dilution for a countable plate and also gives
the rules that are used to pick a dilution for each sample, before including the
code that implements those rules. This allows the protocol to provide research
group members with the logic behind the pre-processing, so that they can adapt
if needed in future experiments. For example, the count range of CFUs used for
the protocol to find a good dilution is about a quarter of the typically
suggested range for this process, and this is because this experiment plated
each sample on a quarter of a plate, rather than using the full plate. By
explaining this reasoning, in the future the protocol could be adapted when
using a full plate rather than a quarter of a plate for each sample.</p>
<p>One tool in RMarkdown that is helpful for this process is its built-in
referencing system. In the previous module, we showed how you can include
bibliographical references in an RMarkdown file. When you write a protocol
within RMarkdown, you can include references in this way to provide background
and support as you explain why you are conducting each step of the
pre-processing. Figure <a href="module20.html#fig:protocolreferences">20.6</a> shows an example of the
elements you use to do this, showing each element in the example protocol for
this module.</p>

</div>
<p>Other helpful tools in RMarkdown are tools for creating equations and tables. As
described in module <a href="module19.html#module19">19</a>, RMarkdown includes a number of formatting
tools. You can create simple tables through basic formatting, or more complex
tables using add-on packages like <code>kableExtra</code>. Math can be typeset using
conventions developed in the LaTeX mark-up language. The module <a href="module19.html#module19">19</a>
provided advice and links to resources on using these types of tools. Figure
<a href="module20.html#fig:protocolequations">20.7</a> gives an example of them in use within the example
protocol for this module.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:protocolequations"></span>

Figure 20.7: Example of including tables and equations in an RMarkdown data pre-processing protocol.
</p>
</div>
<p>You can also include figures, either figures created in R or outside figure files.
Any figures that are created by code in the RMarkdown document will automatically
be included in the protocol. For other graphics, you can include image files
(e.g., png and jpeg files) using the <code>include_graphics</code> function from the
<code>knitr</code> package. You can use options in the code chunk options to specify
the size of the figure in the document and to include a figure caption. The
figures will be automatically numbered in the order they appear in the protocol.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="module20.html#fig:protocolfigures">20.8</a> shows an example of how external figure
files were included in the example protocol. In this case, the functionality
allowed us to include an overview graphic that we created in PowerPoint and

<p>Finally, you can try out even more complex functionality for RMarkdown as you
continue to build data pre-processing protocols for your research group. Figure
<a href="module20.html#fig:protocolyaml">20.9</a> shows an example of using R code within the YAML of the
