<p>Once a researcher has learned to use Git on their own computer for local version
control, they can begin using version control platforms (e.g., GitLab, GitHub)
to collaborate with others under version control. In this module, we will
describe how a research team can benefit from using a version control platform
to work collaboratively. In module <a href="module11.html#module11">11</a>, we’ll give detailed examples
of how you can use a version control platform even if you’re not familiar with
coding.</p>

</h2>
<p>Module <a href="module9.html#module9">9</a> introduced the idea of version control, including the popular
software version control program Git. In this module, we’ll go a
step further, telling you about how you can expand the idea of version control
to leverage it when collaborating across your research team, using <em>version
control platforms</em>. Version control platforms build on the functionality of
version control software, and they can provide you and your team tools
for sharing, tools for visualization, and tools for project management.</p>
<p>Version control platforms offer a number of advantages when collaborating on a
research project that can help to improve your efficiency, rigor, and
reproducibility. Further, as their use has become more popular, there are more
and more resources to help you learn how to use these platforms effectively.
Some of the key advantages of using a version control platform like GitHub to
collaborate on research projects include that the platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can track and merge changes that different collaborators made to the
document</li>
<li>Allows you to create alternative versions of project files (<em>branches</em>), and merge them into the main project as desired</li>
<li>Includes tools for project management, including Issue Trackers</li>
<li>Provides additional backup of project files</li>
<li>Allows you to share project information online, including through hosting websites related to the project or supplemental files related to a manuscript</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of version control platforms are available. Two that are currently very
popular for scientific research are GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/" class="uri">https://github.com/</a>) and GitLab
(<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" class="uri">https://about.gitlab.com/</a>). Both provide free options for scientific
researchers, including the capabilities for using both public and private
repositories in collaboration with other researchers.</p>
<p>Version control platforms are always used in conjunction with version control
software, like the Git software described in module <a href="module9.html#module9">9</a>. A version control
platform adds attractive visual interfaces for working with the project, free or
low-cost online hosting of project files, and team management tools for each
project. In this sense, you can think of Git as the engine and the version
control platform as the driver’s seat, with dashboard, steering wheel, and gears
to leverage the power of the underlying Git software. One scientist, in an
article about Git and GitHub for scientists, highlighted that resources like
GitHub are “essential for collaborative software projects because they enable
the organization and sharing of programming tasks between different remote
contributors.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>232</sup></a></span></p>
<p>A version control platform therefore combines the strengths of a “Track changes”
feature with those of a file sharing platform like Dropbox. To some extent,
Google Docs or Google Drive also combine these features, and some spreadsheet
programs are moving toward rudimentary functionality for version control.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Birch, Lyford-Smith, and Guo, &lt;span&gt;“The Future of Spreadsheets in the Big Data Era.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>233</sup></a></span> However, there are added advantages of version control
platforms. For example, there are version control platforms that are
open-source. GitLab is one example. Since these can be set up on a server that
you own, they can be used to collaborate on projects with sensitive data, and
also can operate directly on the server you’re using to store large
project datasets or to run computationally-intensive pre-processing or analysis.
Also, most version control platforms include tools that help you manage and
track the project. These include “Issue Trackers”, tools for exploring the
history of each file and each change, and features to assign project tasks to
specific team members. The next section will describe the features of version
control platforms that make them helpful as a tool for collaborating on
scientific research. These systems are being leveraged by some scientists both
to manage research projects and to collaborate on writing scientific manuscripts
and grant proposals.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>234</sup></a></span></p>

<div id="why-use-version-control-platforms" class="section level2" number="10.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Why use version control platforms?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-use-version-control-platforms"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Let’s look in detail at some of the advantages of using a version control
program. The first is that they can provide an easy-to-use interface to the
power of Git. Years ago, the use of version control required users to be
familiar with the command line, and to send arcane commands to track the project
files through that interface. However, version control platforms will typically
allow team members to explore and work with the functions from Git in an easier
way than if they try to use the barebones version control software. With the
rising popularity of version control platforms, version control for project
management can be taught relatively quickly to students with a few months—or
even weeks—of coding experience. In fact, version control is beginning to be
used as a method of turning in and grading homework in beginning programming
classes, with students learning these techniques in the first few weeks of class.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Matthew D Beckman et al., &lt;span&gt;“Implementing Version Control with Git and GitHub as a Learning Objective in Statistics and Data Science Courses,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education&lt;/em&gt; 29, no. sup1 (2021): S132–44.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>235</sup></a></span> This would be practically unimaginable without the
user-friendly interface of a version control platform as a wrapper for the power
of the version control software itself.</p>
<p>A second advantage is that a version control platform helps in tracking and
managing contributions from team members. As the proverb about too many cooks in
the kitchen captures, any time you have multiple people working on a project, it
introduces the chance for conflicts—cases where contributions from different
people disagree. While higher-level conflicts, like about what you want the
final product to look like or who should do which jobs, can’t be easily managed
by a computer program, now the complications of integrating everyone’s
contributions—and letting people work in their own space and then bring
together their individual work into one final project—can be. While
programs for version control were originally created to help with programmers
developing code, they can be used now to coordinate group work on numerous types
of file-based projects, including scientific manuscripts, books, and websites.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Raymond, &lt;span&gt;“Understanding Version-Control Systems (DRAFT).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>236</sup></a></span> Although they can work with projects that include
files saved in binary (Word documents, for example), they thrive in projects
with a heavier concentration of text-based files, and so they fit in nicely in a
scientific research / data analysis workflow that is based on data stored in
plain text formats and data analysis scripts written in plain text files, tools
we discuss in other modules.</p>
<p>There is one key feature of modern version control that’s critical to making
this work—resolving changes in files that started the same but were edited in
different ways by different people and now need to be put back together. This
step is called <em>merging</em>. While this is a feature driven by the Git software
itself, you typically won’t use it until you’re collaborating on a project
through a version control platform like GitHub.</p>
<p>You can think of this as merging the changes that two people have made as
they edited a single file, a file where they both started out with identical
copies. Without version control, this process can be time-consuming and
frustrating. As one scientist notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You will likely share your code with multiple lab mates or collaborators,
and they may have suggestions on how to improve it. If you email the code
to multiple people, you will have to manually incorporate all the changes
each of them sends.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>237</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The version control software can handle this for you. Think of the file broken
up into each of its separate lines. There will be some lines that neither person
changed. Those are easy to handle in the “merge”—they stay the same as in the
original copy of the file. Next, there will be some lines that one person
changed, but that the other person didn’t. It turns out that these are pretty
easy to handle, too. If only one person changed the line, then you use their
version—it’s the most up-to-date, since if both people started out with the
same version, it means that the other person didn’t make any changes to that
part of the file. Finally, there may be a few lines that both people changed at
about the same time. These are called <em>merge conflicts</em>. They’re places in the
file where there’s not a clear, easy-to-automate way that the computer can know
which version to put into the integrated, latest version of the file. Different
version control programs handle these merge conflicts in different ways.</p>
<p>For the most common version control program used today, Git, these spots in
the file are flagged with a special set of symbols when you try to integrate the
two updated versions of the file. Along with the special symbols to denote a
conflict, there will also be both versions of the conflicting lines of the
file. Whoever is integrating the files must go in and pick the version of those
lines to use in the integrated version of the file, or write in some compromise
version of those lines that brings in elements from both people’s changes, and
then delete all the symbols denoting that was a conflict and save this latest
version of the file.</p>
<p>Another advantage of a version control platform is that, when you collaborate
using a version control platform, the commit messages provide a way to
communicate across the team members. For example, if one person is the key
person working on a certain file, but has run into a problem with one spot and
asks another team member to take a go, then the second team member isn’t limited
to just looking at the file and then emailing some suggestions. Instead, the
second person can make sure he or she has the latest version of that file, make
the changes they think will help,
<em>commit</em> those changes with a message (a <em>commit message</em>) about why they think
this change will fix the problem, and then push that latest version of the file
back to the first person. If there are several places where it would help to
change the file, then these can be fixed through several separate commits, each
with their own message. The first person, who originally asked for help, can
read through the updates in the file (most platforms for using version control
will now highlight where all these changes are in the file) and read the second
person’s message or messages about why each change might help. Even better, days
or months later, when team members are trying to figure out why a certain change
was made in that part of the file, can go back and read these messages to get an
explanation.</p>
<p>Even better, platforms for using Git often include nice tools for visualizing
differences between two files, providing a more visual way to look at the
differences between files across time points in the project. For example, GitHub
automatically shows changes using colors to highlight additions and subtractions
of plain text for one file compared to another version of it when you look
through a repository’s commit history. Similarly, RStudio provides a new
“Commit” window that can be used to compare differences between the original and
revised version of plain text files at a particular stage in the commit history.
In module <a href="module9.html#module9">9</a>, we’ll walk you through examples of navigating these features.</p>
<p>Another advantage of a version control platform is that they often include extra
tools for project management. These include <em>issue trackers</em>, which allow the
team to keep a running “to-do” list of what needs to be done to complete the
project.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>238</sup></a></span> Sometimes the best tools also happen to be those that
are cheap and easy. In this case, the tool might be so obvious that you don’t
even think of formalizing it as a tool. The “to-do” list is an excellent
example.</p>
<p>A to-do list allows you to take a big task and break it into specific steps
that need to be done to complete that task. It helps with something very key
to solving big problems: being able to zoom between the big picture—big
but vague descriptions of major steps to solve the problem—and the fine
details of how you will tackle each of those steps. As Adam Savage of
the TV show <em>Mythbusters</em> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The value of a list is that it frees you up to think more creatively, by
defining a project’s scope and scale for you on the page, so your brain doesn’t
have to hold on to so much information. The beauty of the checkbox is that it
does the same thing with regard to progress, allowing you to monitor the status
of your project, without having to mentally keep track of everything.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Savage, &lt;em&gt;Every Tool’s a Hammer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>239</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Issues section of a GitHub repository works as this type of to-do list. By
looking at the home Issues page, you see an overview of the tasks you need to
complete to finish the project. For each of these tasks, you can zoom in on
the details by clicking on its Issue. This will take you to a page where your
team can discuss the details of the task, honing in on how you will solve it.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to use emails to discuss progress on a task and talk about how
to solve it. Don’t. Use an Issue instead. This will keep the discussion in one
place, and so you won’t have to go back through emails to find your old
discussion on how you solved it. Also, the Issues section of GitHub doesn’t
delete an Issue once you’ve complete that task. Instead, it allows you to “close”
the Issue. This moves the Issue into a section with all your other closed
issues—it takes it out of your to-do list, but saves the full discussion
somewhere that you’ll be able to find easily in the future if you ever want to
revisit how you solved that problem.</p>
<p>Another advantage of version control platforms is that, if a project uses a
version control platform, it is very easy to share data recorded for the project
publicly. On GitHub, you can set the access to a project to be either public or
private, a setting that can be converted easily from one form to the other over
the course of the project.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Cade Metz, &lt;span&gt;“How GitHub Conquered Google, Microsoft, and Everyone Else,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wired Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>240</sup></a></span> A private project can be viewed
only by fellow team members, while a public project can be viewed by anyone.
This can be used to share the project data online once an associated manuscript
is published, an increasingly common request or requirement from journals and
funding agencies.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>241</sup></a></span> Sharing data allows a more complete
assessment of the research by reviewers and readers and makes it easier for
other researchers to build off the published results in their own work,
extending and adapting the code to explore their own datasets or ask their own
research questions.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>242</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Further, because Git tracks the full history of changes to
these documents, it includes functionality that lets you tag the code and data
at a specific point (for example, the date when a paper was submitted) so that
viewers can look at that specific version of the repository files, even while
the project team continues to move forward in improving files in the directory.
At the more advanced end of functionality, there are even ways to assign a
persistent digital identifier (e.g., a DOI, like those assigned to published articles)
to a specific version of a GitHub repository.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>243</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Version control platforms also help in providing a way to backup study data.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub”&lt;/span&gt;; Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub”&lt;/span&gt;; Perkel, &lt;span&gt;“Git.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>244</sup></a></span> Together, Git and GitHub
provide a structure where the project directory (repository) is copied on
multiple computers. Under a distributed model, each collaborator will
have their own copy of all project files on their local computer. All project
files are also stored on the remote repository to which you all push and pull
commits. If you are using the GitHub platform, this will be GitHub’s servers; if
you use GitLab, you can set up the system on your own server. Each time you push
or pull from the remote copy of the project repository, you are syncing your
copy of the project files with those on other computers.</p>
<p>This set-up makes it easy to bring all the project files onto a new
computer—all you have to do is clone the project repository. It also ensures
that there are copies of the full project directory, including all its files, in
multiple places.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>245</sup></a></span> Further, not only is the data backed up
across multiple computers, but so is the full history of all changes made to
that data and the recorded messages explaining those changes, through the
repositories commit messages.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>246</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Leips highlights the importance of backup for research data and code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Backup, backup, backup—this is the main action you can take to care for your
computers and your data. Many PIs assume that backup systems are inherently
permanent and foolproof, and it often takes a loss to remind one that
materials break, systems fail, and humans make mistakes. Even if your data
are backed up at work, have at least one other backup system. Keep at least
one backup off site, in case of a diaster in the lab (yes, fires and floods
do happen). It doesn’t make much sense to have two separate backup systems stored
next to each other in a drawer.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;JEFF LEIPS, &lt;span&gt;“At the Helm: Leading Your Laboratory,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Genetics Research&lt;/em&gt; 92, no. 4 (2010): 325–26.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>247</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, version control platforms like GitHub can be used for a number
of supplementary tasks for your research project. These include publishing
webpages or other web resources linked to the project and otherwise improving
public engagement with the project, including by allowing other researchers
to copy and adapt your project through a process called <em>forking</em>. Version
control platforms also provide a supplemental backup to project files.</p>
<p>First, GitHub can be used to collaborate on, host, and publish websites and
other online content.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>248</sup></a></span> Version control systems have been used by
some for a long time to help in writing longform materials like books (e.g.,
<span class="citation">Raymond<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Art of Unix Programming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>249</sup></a></span>); new tools are making the process even easier. The GitHub Pages
functionality, for example, is now being used to host a number of books created
in R using the <code>bookdown</code> package, including the online version of this book.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookdown?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>250</sup></a></span> The <code>blogdown</code> package similarly can be used to create websites,
either for individual researchers, for research labs, or for specific projects
or collaborations.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blogdown?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>251</sup></a></span> Further, if a project includes the creation of
scientific software, a version control platform can be used to share that
software—as well as associated documentation—in a format that is easy for
others to work with.</p>
<p>The platform can also be used to share supplemental material for a manuscript,
including the code used for pre-processing and analyzing data. Perez highlights
this functionality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The traditional way to promote scientific software is by publishing an
associated paper in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, though, as pointed
out by Buckheir and Donoho, this is just advertising. Additional steps can boost
the visibility of an organization. For example, GitHub Pages are simple websites
freely hosted by GitHub. Users can create and host blog websites, help pages,
manuals, tutorials, and websites related to specific projects.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>252</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With GitHub, while only collaborators on a public project can directly change
the code, anyone else can <em>suggest</em> changes through a process of copying a
version of the project (<em>forking</em> it). This allows someone to make the changes
they would like to suggest directly to a copy of the code, and then ask the
project’s owners to consider integrating the changes back into the main version
of the project through a <em>pull request</em>. GitHub therefore creates a platform
where people can explore, adapt, and add to other people’s coding projects,
enabling a community of coders.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>253</sup></a></span> Because of this
functionality, GitHub has been described as “a social network for software
development”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perkel, &lt;span&gt;“Git.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>254</sup></a></span> and as “a kind of bazaar that offers just about
any piece of code you might want—and so much of it free.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Metz, &lt;span&gt;“How GitHub Conquered Google, Microsoft, and Everyone Else.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>255</sup></a></span>
This same process can be leveraged for others to copy and adapt code—this is
particularly helpful in ensuring that a software or research project won’t be
“orphaned” if its main developer is unavailable (e.g., retires, dies), but
instead can be picked up and continued by other interested researchers.
Copyright statements and licenses within code projects help to clarify
attribution and rights in these cases.</p>
<p>In module <a href="module11.html#module11">11</a>, we describe practical ways to leverage these resources
within your research group. We include instructions both for team leaders—who
may not code but may want to use GitHub within projects to help manage the
projects—as well as researchers who work directly with data and code for the
research team. There are also a number of excellent resources that are now
available that walk users through how to set up and use a version control
platform. The process is particularly straightforward when the research project
files are collected in an RStudio Project format, as described in earlier
modules.</p>
