<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Example: Creating a ‘Project’ template</h2>
<p>We will walk through a real example, based on the experiences of one of our
Co-Is, of establishing the format for a research group’s ‘Project’ template,
creating that template using RStudio, and initializing a new research project
directory using the created template. This example will be from a
laboratory-based research group that studies the efficacy of tuberculosis drugs
in a murine model.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a ‘Project’ template in RStudio to initialize consistently-formatted
‘Project’ directories</li>
<li>Initialize a new ‘Project’ directory using this template</li>
</ul>
<p>For this module, we’ll show how to create an R Project template to manage data
from an example set of projects. We will walk through the process of creating a
project directory template that could be used to manage and analyze data from
any of the specific studies in this set of studies.</p>
<p>The full directory of files for this example can be found at [GitHub address],
where you can download them or explore them online. All files for this
project can be stored within a well-designed directory, and this directory
can be enhanced into something called an R Project very easily. In this
module, we’ll explore how to use an R Project and what advantages it
offers compared to other ways of organizing the files associated with
a study. In particular, we’ll build on ideas from earlier modules about
creating reproducible data collection templates, as in this example, the
use of a common template across many studies in a set makes it very
easy to create and apply a common reporting template to the data, easily
creating a reproducible report for each of the nineteen studies in the
example set of studies. Further, we’ll look at how this organization
allows not only for reporting on specific studies in a reproducible way,
but also makes it easier to create an overall report that combines
results and details from all studies in the set.</p>
<div id="description-of-the-example-set-of-studies" class="section level3" number="2.8.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.1</span> Description of the example set of studies</h3>
<p>As a motivating example, we’ll use an example based on a set of real immunology
experiments. This example highlights how a research laboratory will often
conduct a similar type of experiment many times, so it lets us demonstrate how
the design of the project’s files within a project directory can be reused
across similar experiments. It will allow us to show you how you can move from
designing a file directory for a single experiment to designing one that can be
used repeatedly, and then how you can take advantage of consistency in the
directory structure across projects to make tools and templates that can be
reused.</p>
<p>This example set of studies covers a group of studies to explore novel
treatments for tuberculosis. While treatments exist for tuberculosis, the
current treatment regime is lengthy and involves a combination of multiple
drugs. If the treatment is not completed, it can result in the development and
spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains, and so the treatment is sometimes
required to be done under observation <span class="citation">(Barry and Cheung 2009)</span>. If the patient has a
strain of tuberculosis that is resistant to some of the first-line drugs, they
need to be treated with second-line drugs, which can have serious side effects
<span class="citation">(Barry and Cheung 2009)</span>. There is a critical need to develop more candidate drugs
against this disease, given all the limitations and struggles of the current
treatment regime.</p>
<p>Each study investigates how mice that are challenged with tuberculosis respond
to different treatments, both in terms of how well they handle the treatment
(assessed by checking if their weight decreases notably while on treatment) and
also how well the treatment manages to limit the growth of tuberculosis in the
mouse’s lungs.</p>
<p>These example studies were conducted with similar designs and similar
goals—all aimed to test candidate treatments for tuberculosis. Most studies in
this set tested one or more treatments as well as one or more controls. The
controls could include negative controls, like saline solution, or positive
controls, like a drug already in use to treat the disease, isoniazid. A few of
the studies tested only controls, to help in developing baseline expectations
for things like the bacterial load in different mouse strains used in studies in
the set. The set of studies tested some treatments that were monotherapies (only
one drug given to the animal) as well as some that were combinations of two or
three different drugs. For many of the drugs that were tested, they were tested
at different doses and, in some cases, different methods of delivery or
different mouse models.</p>
<p>Each of the treatments were given to several mice that had been infected with
<em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. During the treatment, the mice were weighed
regularly. This weight measurement helps to determine if a particular treatment
is well-tolerated by the animals—if not, it may show through the treated mice
losing weight during treatment. For convenience, the mice were not weighed
individually. Instead, mice with the same treatment were kept in a single cage,
and the entire cage was weighed, the weight of the cage itself factored out, and
the average weight of mice for that treatment determined by dividing the weight
of all mice in the cage by the number of mice in the cage. After a period of
time, the mice were sacrificed and one lobe from their lungs was used to
determine each mouse’s bacterial load, through plating the material from the
lobe and counting the colony forming units (CFUs). One aim of the data analysis
is to compare the bacterial load of mice under various treatments to the
bacterial load of mice in the control group.</p>
<p>The full set of studies included 19 different studies. These were conducted at
different times, but the data for all of the studies can be collected using a
common format. In this module, as well as the following two, we’ll be exploring
how you can use RStudio’s Project functionality to organize data from one or
more studies. We’ll particularly focus on how, by using a common format for data
collection, you can create tools that can be used repeatedly for different
experiments to ensure that methods are the same across all studies of a similar
type, as well as to improve the reproducibility of the studies.</p>
<p>There are a few steps you’ll need to take to create this type of basic project directory
template:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>List the data you typically collect or files you create for that type of study or experiment</li>
<li>Create template files for any data collection that is typical for that type of study
or experiment. Use example or placeholder data to create examples of those files.</li>
<li>Create a directory structure that divides the types of files into subdirectories of similar
types.</li>
<li>Create one or more templates of report files that access and report on the data in the
project template</li>
</ol>

<div id="step-1-survey-of-data-collected-for-the-projects" class="section level3" number="2.8.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.2</span> Step 1: Survey of data collected for the projects</h3>
<p>For the example set of studies for this module, there are a few types of data
that we plan to typically collect for each study. First, we will be recording
metadata for each experiment. This will include a study ID, as well as details
like the mouse strain that we used in that experiment, the route used to
administer the treatment, the treatments per week and total weeks of treatment,
the inoculum used for the challenge, and so on. Second, we’ll be recording some
details about each experimental group that was tested. This includes the drug or
drugs that were tested, doses of each, and some exact details about the
treatment regimen for that group. Both of these types of data can be recorded at
the beginning of the study. Two other types of data will also be recorded, both
of them during the study rather than at the start. The first is weights of the
mice each week. These weights will be recorded for each treatment group each
week of treatment, to help see if there are drugs that are poorly tolerated by
the mice (which can show up through weight decreases in mice in that group). The
second is the bacterial load in the lungs of each mouse at the end of the
treatment period.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through the types of data that were collected for each study. First,
there was some metadata recorded for each study. Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:metadata">2.29</a>
gives an example. This includes information about the strain of mouse that was
used in the study, treatment details (including the method of giving the drug or
drugs, how often they were given each week, and for how many weeks), how much
bacteria the animals were exposed to (measured both in terms of the inoculum
they were given and their bacterial load one day after they were given that
inoculum, which was based on sacrificing one animal the day after challenging
all the animals with the bacteria), and, if the study included a novel drug as
part of the tested treatment, the batch number of that drug.</p>
<div class="figure fullwidth"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:metadata"></span>

<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 2.29: Example of recording metadata for a study in the set of example studies for this module.
</p>
</div>
<p>Next, the researchers recorded some information about each treatment group
within the experiment. This typically included at least one negative control. In
some cases, there was also a positive control, in which the animals were treated
with a drug that’s in standard use against tuberculosis already (e.g.,
isoniazid). Most studies would also test one or more treatments, which could
include monotherapies or combined therapies. Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:treatmentdetails">2.30</a>
shows an example of the data that were recorded on each treatment in the study.
These data include the names and doses of up to three drugs in each treatment,
as well as a column where the researcher can provide detailed specifications of
the treatment.</p>
<div class="figure fullwidth"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:treatmentdetails"></span>
<img src="figures/project_treatment_details.png" alt="Example of recording treatment details for a study in the set of example studies for this module." width="\textwidth"  />
<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 2.30: Example of recording treatment details for a study in the set of example studies for this module.
</p>
</div>
<p>Once the animals were challenged with the bacteria, treatment began, and two
main types of data were measured and recorded. First, the mice were weighed once
a week. For convenience, the mice were not weighed
individually. Instead, mice with the same treatment were kept in a single cage,
and the entire cage was weighed, the weight of the cage itself factored out, and
the average weight of mice for that treatment determined by dividing the weight
of all mice in the cage by the number of mice in the cage. These weights were converted to a measure of the percent change in
weight since the start of treatment. If the animals’ weights decrease during the
treatment, it is a marker that the treatment is not well-tolerated by the
animals. Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:mouseweight">2.31</a> shows an example of how these data were
recorded. All animals within a treatment group were kept in the same cage, and
this cage was measured once a week. By dividing the weight of all animals in the
cage by the number of animals, the researchers could estimate the average weight
of animals in that treatment group, which is recorded as shown in Figure
<a href="#fig:mouseweights"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<div class="figure fullwidth"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:mouseweight"></span>
<img src="figures/project_mouse_weights.png" alt="Example of recording weekly weights of mice in each treatment group for the example set of studies." width="\textwidth"  />
<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 2.31: Example of recording weekly weights of mice in each treatment group for the example set of studies.
</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, after the treatment period, the mice were sacrificed and a portion of
each mouse’s lung was used to estimate the bacterial load in that mouse. Figure
<a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:bacterialload">2.32</a> shows an example of how the data on the bacterial load
in each mouse was recorded.</p>
<div class="figure fullwidth"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:bacterialload"></span>

<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 2.32: Example of recording the bacterial load in the lungs of each mouse at the end of treatment for the example set of studies.
</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see, these data were all recorded using templates that were designed
for the tidy collection of laboratory data (see modules 2.4 and 2.5). These
spreadsheets were used only to record the data, and then processing, analysis,
and visualization were done in a separate file.</p>
<p>To create the project directory template for these studies, then, we’ll create
data collection templates for each of these types of data. We’ll create a
separate spreadsheet for each type of data, but we can group them into files if
we’d like. In our example, we created two files to store this type of data, one
for the metadata that are recorded at the start of the experiment (overall
experiment details and the details of each tested treatment) and one for the
data that are collected over the course of the experiment (mouse weights and
bacterial loads). Within each file, we’ve used separate sheets to record the
different types of data. This allows us to keep similar types of data together
in the same file, while having a tidy collection format for each specific type
of data. [Figure]</p>
<div class="figure fullwidth"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:projectdatacollection"></span>
<img src="figures/project_data_collection.png" alt="Data collection templates for the example project directory template. These templates were created in two files, one for metadata, which is saved in the main directory of the project, and one for data collected in the laboratory during the experiment, which is saved in the 'data' subdirectory. Each file is saved as a spreadsheet file, with two sheets in each file to store different types of data." width="\textwidth"  />
<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 2.33: Data collection templates for the example project directory template. These templates were created in two files, one for metadata, which is saved in the main directory of the project, and one for data collected in the laboratory during the experiment, which is saved in the ‘data’ subdirectory. Each file is saved as a spreadsheet file, with two sheets in each file to store different types of data.
</p>
</div>
<p>All of these data collection files are designed using the principles of tidy data
collection (modules [x]). This will ensure that it will be easy to read these
recorded data in a programming language like R for analysis and visualization.
Specifically, when we designed these template files, we thought a lot about
things like using a two-dimensional structure (one row of header names and then
values within each of the columns), using column names that would be easy for
a programming language to parse (e.g., no special characters or spaces in the
column names), and so on.</p>
<p>In modules [x], we showed how you can create tidy data collection templates to
use to collect data, and how these can be paired with reproducible reporting
tools to separate the steps of data collection and reporting (modules [x] go
into much more depth on these reproducible reporting tools). Once you have
decided on the types of data that you will usually collect for the type of study
that this template is for, you can use that process to create tidy data
collection templates for each type of data.</p>
<p>In addition to the data that you record in the laboratory by hand, the type of
study may also typically have data that’s generated and recorded by laboratory
equipment. For example, the type of study may often include data collected from
flow cytometry, to measure certain cell populations in samples, or from mass
spectometry, to measure levels of certain molecules. For these data, the
recording format will typically be determined by the equipment, and so you won’t
need to create data collection templates for the data. However, you should store
these data files in your project directory as well, where they are easy to
access and integrate with other data as you analyze the data for the study.</p>
<p>The recorded data files and the files that come directly from equipment can all
be considered raw data files. In addition, you may typically create some files
with pre-processed data. For example, if you have sequencing data [?], you may
initially get large [what type] files from the [what type] equipment. You may
use a program like [what] to pre-process these files to [do what]. In addition
to saving the raw [what type] data files, you’ll also want to save the processed
data files in your project directory, since these are the files that you’ll
analyze and integrate with other data from the project.</p>
<p>When we created the template for each type of data, we added placeholder data
(formatted in red to indicate that it is placeholder, rather than final
data). This is so the researcher can see an example of how to enter data in
the template when they start a new project.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:replacingplaceholdermetadata">2.34</a> gives an example of this process.
One of the files that is included in the example template directory shown
earlier is a spreadsheet to record metadata on the experiment. This spreadsheet
file has two sheets, one that records overall metadata on the study (for
example, the weeks of treatment given and the strain of mouse used) and one that
records details on each of the treatments that was tested. In the file in the
template directory, these spreadsheet pages include placeholder data. These are
formatted in red, so that they visually can be identified as placeholders. By
including these placeholder data, the researcher can see an example of the
format that you expect to be used in recording data in this file. Once the
project template is copied, the researcher will replace these data with the real
data, and then change the font color to black to indicate that the placeholder
data have been replaced (Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:replacingplaceholdermetadata">2.34</a>).</p>
<div class="figure fullwidth"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:replacingplaceholdermetadata"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>Another sheet of this spreadsheet allows the researcher to record the details of
each of the treatments that were tested in the experiment. Again, placeholder
data are included in the template in a red font to help show the researcher how
to record the data, and these are meant to be replaced with real data from the
specific experiment (Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:replacingplaceholdertreatment2">2.35</a>). A
similar format is used in the template file to record data from the experiment,
including the weights of each animal over each week of treatment and the final
bacterial load in each animal at the end of treatment. Again, there are
placeholder values in the template file, which the researcher will replace with
real data after copying the project template for a new experiment.</p>

<div id="step-2-organizing-a-project-directory" class="section level3" number="2.8.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.3</span> Step 2: Organizing a project directory</h3>
<p>We will walk through the process of creating a project directory template that
could be used to manage and analyze data from any of the specific studies in
this set of studies. We’ll cover two ways that you could do this. The first is
simpler—it involves creating a basic file directory with the desired template
files and file directory structure and then copying this file directory every
time you want to start a new project for a study in this set of studies. The
second way is a bit more complex and time-consuming to set up, but has the
benefit of providing a very nice interface for members of your laboratory group
to use when they start a new project. This second way is to create a full R
Project template that can be accessed from RStudio anytime you create a new R
Project. This type of template may not be worth the extra set-up time for
project types that your research group only uses rarely, but for types of
projects that your group conducts time and time again, it can be a powerful way
to enforce a common project directory structure, and this in turn will allow
your group to create reusable tools that work in coordination with this project
structure.</p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the more basic way to create a project template. This
involves no fancy tools—in fact, it’s so straightforward that at first it
might seem to simple to be useful. For this basic approach, you will create an
example file directory that includes template files and that captures you
desired project directory structure, and then members of your group will copy
and rename that template every time they start a new project of that type.</p>
<p>In the example project that we just described, you can see that we ended up
with a lot of different files. We used separate files for collecting data and
for creating a preliminary report on that data. For collecting the data, we could
either use separate sheets in one spreadsheet file, or entirely separate files,
or some combination. The end result is that we have several project files,
in comparison to if we had used a single sheet of a spreadsheet file to
both record and work with the data.</p>
<p>Once you have determined the types of files that you’ll normally include in your
project, you can decide how to organize them into subdirectories in a project
file directory. As you do this, it will be helpful to have example or template
files for each file type. For data that you will record yourself, these can be
the templates that you developed to collect the data in a tidy format (modules
[x]), while for data from equipment, these can just be one or more example files
from the equipment that you have collected for a past project. Having these
example files will help you to develop a template project report that can input
the type of data that you typically collect for this type of project.</p>

<div id="step-3-designing-a-report-template" class="section level3" number="2.8.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.4</span> Step 3: Designing a report template</h3>
<p>With the previous steps, you will have determined the types of files you normally
have for this type of study, as well as structured the project directory to organize
these files. The next step is to create a template report. You can create this using
tools for reproducible reports—in R, a key tool for this is RMarkdown. Here, we’ll
cover using this tool for creating a report briefly, but there are many more details
in modules [x].</p>
<p>When you create a project directory template, we recommend that you create a
subdirectory named something like “reports” to use to store any Rmarkdown report
files for the project. This organization will make it clear where you’ve stored your
reports in the project directory. You’ll be able to use file and directory pathnames
to access all the data in the project, so it will be easy to use the study’s data
in the report even if they’re in separate subdirectories. There’s only one tool
you’ll need to do this—you’ll need to learn how to use relative pathnames
within R code to access files in a different part of your project directory.</p>
<p>We created an Rmarkdown file that does this analysis and visualization and
included it in the project template directory. This means that the report file
will be copied and available each time someone copies the project template
directory at the start of a new project. We wrote the code in a way that will
input data that are stored in the data collection files that also come with the
project directory template. Since we named those files in the directory
template, we can refer to them with the same name in the code for the report. We
wrote the code in the report in a way that it will still run if there are more
or fewer observations in any of the data collection files, so the report
template has some flexibility in terms of how each study in the set of studies
might vary. For example, in the example set of studies, some of the experiments
were run using only a control group of mice, while others were run to test as
many as [x] different treatment groups. The report template can accommodate
these differences across studies in the set of studies.</p>
<p>Specifically, for this set of
studies a preliminary report was designed, with an example shown in Figure [x].
This report uses the first page to provide a nicely format version of the
metadata for the study, including a table with overall details and a table with
details for each specific treatment that was tested. The second page provides a
graph that shows the percent weight change for mice in each treatment group
compared to the weight of that group at the start of treatment. The third page
provides a graph that shows the bacterial loads in each mouse, grouped by
treatment, as well as the results of running a statistical test to test, for
each treatment group, the hypothesis that the mean of a transformed version of
the measure of bacterial load (log-10) for the group was the same as for the
untreated control group.</p>

in Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:prelimreport">2.36</a>. If you look back to the data collection for
this study (e.g., Figures <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:metadata">2.29</a> and <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:treatmentdetails">2.30</a>),
you can see that all of the information in these tables was pulled from data
recorded at the start of the study.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:bactcompare">2.39</a> shows the last page of the report. This page

for each mouse is shown with a point, and these points are grouped by the
treatment group of the mouse. Boxplots are added to show the distribution across
the mice in each group. The color is used to show whether the treatment was a

second part of the page gives a table with the results from running a
statistical analysis to compare the bacterial load for mice in each treatment
group to the bacterial load in the mice in the untreated control group. Color is
added to the table to highlight treatments that had a large difference in

difference from the untreated control was estimated to be statistically
significant. All the data for these results, including the labels for the plot,
are from the data collected in the data collection templates shown earlier.</p>

</div>
<p>In the report, we’ll design the script for the report (the RMarkdown file) so
that it can leverage the order in how we’ve arranged files in the file system,
since this is enforced by the project directory template and so is the same
across different projects. This will let us repeat and reuse code scripts across
all the projects that use this template. This strategy is used often in handling
complex bioinformatics data <span class="citation">(Buffalo 2015)</span>, but it can also be
leveraged to improve the reproducibility and reliability when only using less
complex data recorded in the laboratory, as with the data shown in the example
for this module.</p>
<p>When it comes to project directories, it turns out that you can use the
directory structure in your favor when you create script-based reports, like
RMarkdown reports. There are functions in R, for example, that will allow you to
print all the files in a specified subdirectory. Say that you have several flow
cytometry files in a subdirectory of the “data” subdirectory called “flow_data”.
You could use this function in R to create a list of all the files in that
subdirectory, and then you can run other functions to do the same operations on
all of those files.</p>
<p>The project template also includes a file that provides a template to create a report
based on the data from the experiment. This file is created using the RMarkdown format,
which combines text with executable code. You can create this template so that it
inputs the experimental data from the file formats created for the data recording
files in the project template. By doing this, the researcher should be able to “knit”
this report for a new experiment, and it should recreate the report based on the
data recorded for that experiment (Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:makingareport">2.40</a>). By knitting
this template report, you can create a nicely formatted version of the report for
the experimental data (Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:examplereport1">2.41</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.5</span> Step 4: Testing the project template and refining it</h3>
<ul>
<li>Edge cases: For example, sometimes only one treatment condition, so not
possible to run a statistical test comparing conditions</li>
<li>Didn’t think of something: Maybe they add an assay?</li>
<li>Iterative process to refine what goes in the report. What do we need
to know from each experiment?</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases, you may have a more complex design for your project directory. For
example, if you were collecting flow cytometry data for the project as well, then
you would want a subdirectory in the project that is specifically designed to
store files from the flow cytometry component of the experiment. This subdirectory
would likely include several files, rather than just one. Further, you would not
know ahead of time what the name of these files would be (as you do with the data
collection template files that are included in the template directory). However,
you can still easily write code for a template report file that will work with
multiple files of a similar type, even if you don’t know what the names will be,
as long as you know what the name of their subdirectory will be. There are functions
in R like <code>list.files</code> that can be used to list all the file names for the files
in a given directory. You can use this function to create a vector of all the file
names. For example, you could run:</p>
<p>to get an object (<code>flow_filepaths</code>) that lists each of the filepaths for the files
stored in the “flow_data” subdirectory within the “data” subdirectory of the
project. You could then “map” a function or group of functions across these
files to read them in, process them, and join them into a single dataframe in R.
By using this process, you can write template code in the report for the project
that should work in most cases for the data that you collect for a given type of
study.</p>
<p>The report template is included in the project directory template, so it will be
copied and available for you to use anytime you start a new project using that
template. However, you are not obligated to keep the report identical to the template.
Instead, the template report serves as a starting point, and you can add to it or
adapt it as you work on a study.</p>
<p>For example, in our example template report, we’ve included the results of
applying a statistical test that compares each treatment group to the control
group. Instead, for a specific study of this type, you may want to control
treatments against each other. For example, some of the studies in this example
set of studies include a positive control group, where the mice are treated with
a drug that is already in common use for the disease. In some cases, the
researcher may want to control the bacterial load in groups treated with a novel
drug to groups treated with the positive control. You could easy add to the
report template in that case, adding statistical tests where you compare
different treatment groups to each other.</p>
<p>In the example, there was one clear edge case that came up a few times.
For some experiments, only only treatment group was used. In these cases,
we can create a report with most of the usual elements, but we can’t
run a statistical analysis that compares groups because there is only
one group.</p>
<p>We discovered this edge case as we tried applying our project template to
multiple experiments. Once we identified it, there were a few approaches
we could take. First, we could adapt the reports by hand in cases where
this happens. To do this, we just need to open the Rmd report for the
report file for those projects and remove the part that compares across
groups. If this edge case happens rarely, this can be a reasonable
approach.</p>
<p>Another approach is to write code in the report template that addresses
these cases. Because the full report is in code, we can write in code
that checks how many treatment groups were included and only runs the
statistical analysis if it was more than one group. This is the
approach we took in this example.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.6</span> Step 5: Using the project template</h3>
<ul>
<li>Value comes from using it consistently</li>
<li>This example is for a set of very similar studies—the same idea can
apply for developing project templates for a wider range of studies, but
it will require more thought to have something that works across more
variety</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure <a href="2.7-module7.html#fig:basicprojecttemplateuse">2.26</a> gives a basic walk-through of the
simple steps you’ll use to start a new project directory once you’ve created
this type of template. First, you will find the project directory template in
your computer’s file system, copy it to where you’d like to save the files for
the new project, and rename the directory to your new project’s name. At this
point, you can use RStudio to make this directory an RStudio Project. Next,
you’ll open the data collection template files and replace the placeholder
example data in the template (shown in red font) with the real data from your
study. The placeholder data can help you remember the format you should use to
record the real data. Finally, once you’ve recorded the data for the study or
experiment, you can open the example report template file. If you’ve designed
this report template well, it should run with the new data you’ve recorded to
create a report for the experiment. At this stage, you can add to the report
or customize it for the new project by changing the Rmarkdown file and re-rendering
it to update the report.</p>

</div>
<p>One cool thing that you can do, when you have all the project directories
and report templates set up in the same way, is automate the rendering of
the reports from all the projects. Parameterized Rmarkdown report tools
can help in doing this. This is especially useful if you want to create
new reports down the road to run on all the data from a set of similar
experiments.</p>

conduct a similar type of experiment many times, so it lets us demonstrate how
the design of the project’s files within a project directory can be reused
across similar experiments. It will allow us to show you how you can move from
designing a file directory for a single experiment to designing one that can be
used repeatedly, and then how you can take advantage of consistency in the
directory structure across projects to make tools and templates that can be
reused.</p>

<p>“To say that scientists erred in assuming that the first-line drugs from the
1950s would be sufficient to combat TB is a profound understatement.” <span class="citation">(Barry and Cheung 2009)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The current treatment course, which was developed in the 1960s, is a
demanding regimen consisting of four first-line drugs created in the 1950s and
1960s: isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. Patients who follow
the regimen as directed take an average of 130 doses of the drugs, ideally under
direct observation by a health care worker. This combination is extremely
effective against active, drug-susceptible TB as long as patients are compliant
and complete the entire six- to nine-month course. Drug-resistant strains
develop when patients do not complete the full protocol, whether because they
start to feel better or because their drug supply is interrupted for some
reason. Inconsistent use of antibiotics gives the bacteria time to evolve into a
drug-resistant form. Once a drug-resistant strain has developed in one person,
that individual can spread the resistant version to others. … According to the
World Health Organization [as of 2009], nearly 5 percent of the roughly eight
million new TB cases that occur each year involve strains of Mtb that are
resistant to the two most commonly used drugs in the current first-line regimen:
isoniazip and rifampin. Most cases of this so-called multidrug-resistant TB
(MDR-TB) are treatable, but they require therapy for up to two years with
second-line anti-TB drugs that produce severe side effects. Moreover, MDR-TB
treatment can cost up to 1,400 times more than regular treatment. … Worst of
all, over the past few years health surveys have revealed an even more ominous
threat, that of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). This type … is
resistant to virtually all the highly-effective drugs used in second-line
therapy.” <span class="citation">(Barry and Cheung 2009)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The examples for this and the next few modules are based on a collection of
studies that were conducted with similar designs and similar goals—all aimed
to test candidate treatments for tuberculosis. Most studies in this set tested
one or more treatments as well as one or more controls. The controls could
include negative controls, like saline solution, or positive controls, like a
drug already in use to treat the disease, isoniazid. A few of the studies tested
only controls, to help in developing baseline expectations for things like the
bacterial load in different mouse strains used in studies in the set. The
set of studies tested some treatments that were monotherapies (only one drug
given to the animal) as well as some that were combinations of two or three
different drugs. For many of the drugs that were tested, they were tested at
different doses and, in some cases, different methods of delivery or different
mouse models.</p>
<p>Each of the treatments were given to several mice that had been infected with
<em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. During the treatment, the mice were weighed
regularly. This weight measurement helps to determine if a particular treatment
is well-tolerated by the animals—if not, it may show through the treated mice
losing weight during treatment. After a period of
time, the mice were sacrificed and one lobe from their lungs was used to
determine each mouse’s bacterial load, through plating the material from the
lobe and counting the colony forming units (CFUs). One aim of the data analysis
is to compare the bacterial load of mice under various treatments to the
bacterial load of mice in the control group.</p>
<p>The full set of studies included 19 different studies. These were conducted at
different times, but the data for all of the studies can be collected using a
common format. In this module, as well as the following two, we’ll be exploring
how you can use RStudio’s Project functionality to organize data from one or
more studies. We’ll particularly focus on how, by using a common format for data
collection, you can create tools that can be used repeatedly for different
experiments to ensure that methods are the same across all studies of a similar
type, as well as to improve the reproducibility of the studies.</p>
<p>Let’s walk
through the types of data that were collected for each study.
First, there was some metadata recorded for each study. Figure
<a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:metadata">2.29</a> gives an example. This includes information about the strain
of mouse that was used in the study, treatment details (including the method of
giving the drug or drugs, how often they were given each week, and for how many
weeks), how much bacteria the animals were exposed to (measured both in terms of
the inoculum they were given and their bacterial load one day after they were
given that inoculum, which was based on sacrificing one animal the day after
challenging all the animals with the bacteria), and, if the study included a
novel drug as part of the tested treatment, the batch number of that drug.</p>
<div class="figure fullwidth"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:metadata1"></span>
<img src="figures/project_metadata.png" alt="Example of recording metadata for a study in the set of example studies for this module." width="\textwidth"  />
<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 2.43: Example of recording metadata for a study in the set of example studies for this module.
</p>
</div>
<p>Next, the researchers recorded some information about each treatment group
within the experiment. This typically included at least one negative control. In
some cases, there was also a positive control, in which the animals were treated
with a drug that’s in standard use against tuberculosis already (e.g.,
isoniazid). Most studies would also test one or more treatments, which could
include monotherapies or combined therapies. Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:treatmentdetails">2.30</a>
shows an example of the data that were recorded on each treatment in the study.
These data include the names and doses of up to three drugs in each treatment,
as well as a column where the researcher can provide detailed specifications of
the treatment.</p>
<div class="figure fullwidth"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:treatmentdetails1"></span>

<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 2.44: Example of recording treatment details for a study in the set of example studies for this module.
</p>
</div>
<p>Once the animals were challenged with the bacteria, treatment began, and two
main types of data were measured and recorded. First, the mice were weighed once
a week. For convenience, the mice were not weighed
individually. Instead, mice with the same treatment were kept in a single cage,
and the entire cage was weighed, the weight of the cage itself factored out, and
the average weight of mice for that treatment determined by dividing the weight
of all mice in the cage by the number of mice in the cage. These weights were converted to a measure of the percent change in
weight since the start of treatment. If the animals’ weights decrease during the
treatment, it is a marker that the treatment is not well-tolerated by the
animals. Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:mouseweight">2.31</a> shows an example of how these data were
recorded. All animals within a treatment group were kept in the same cage, and
this cage was measured once a week. By dividing the weight of all animals in the
cage by the number of animals, the researchers could estimate the average weight
of animals in that treatment group, which is recorded as shown in Figure
<a href="#fig:mouseweights"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>

<p class="caption marginnote shownote">

</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, after the treatment period, the mice were sacrificed and a portion of
each mouse’s lung was used to estimate the bacterial load in that mouse. Figure
<a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:bacterialload">2.32</a> shows an example of how the data on the bacterial load
in each mouse was recorded.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see, these data were all recorded using templates that were designed
for the tidy collection of laboratory data (see modules 2.4 and 2.5). These
spreadsheets were used only to record the data, and then processing, analysis,
and visualization were done in a separate file. Specifically, for this set of
studies a preliminary report was designed, with an example shown in Figure [x].
This report uses the first page to provide a nicely format version of the
metadata for the study, including a table with overall details and a table with
details for each specific treatment that was tested. The second page provides a
graph that shows the percent weight change for mice in each treatment group
compared to the weight of that group at the start of treatment. The third page
provides a graph that shows the bacterial loads in each mouse, grouped by
treatment, as well as the results of running a statistical test to test, for
each treatment group, the hypothesis that the mean of a transformed version of
the measure of bacterial load (log-10) for the group was the same as for the
untreated control group.</p>

difference from the untreated control was estimated to be statistically
significant. All the data for these results, including the labels for the plot,
are from the data collected in the data collection templates shown earlier.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.8</span> Designing the template for the example set of projects</h3>
<p>In the example project that we just described, you can see that we ended up
with a lot of different files. We used separate files for collecting data and
for creating a preliminary report on that data. For collecting the data, we could
either use separate sheets in one spreadsheet file, or entirely separate files,
or some combination. The end result is that we have several project files,
in comparison to if we had used a single sheet of a spreadsheet file to
both record and work with the data.</p>
<p>Figure [x] gives an example of a project directory organization that might make
sense for the example set of studies described at the beginning of this module. …
In the report, we’ll design the script for the report (the RMarkdown file) so
that it can leverage the order in how we’ve arranged files in the file system,
since this is enforced by the project directory template and so is the same
across different projects. This will let us repeat and reuse code scripts across
all the projects that use this template. This strategy is used often in handling
complex bioinformatics data <span class="citation">(Buffalo 2015)</span>, but it can also be
leveraged to improve the reproducibility and reliability when only using less
complex data recorded in the laboratory, as with the data shown in the example
for this module.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:replacingplaceholdermetadata">2.34</a> gives an example of this process. One
of the files that is included in the example template directory shown earlier is
a spreadsheet to record metadata on the experiment. This spreadsheet file has two
sheets, one that records overall metadata on the study (for example, the weeks of
treatment given and the strain of mouse used) and one that records details on each
of the treatments that was tested. In the file in the template directory, these
spreadsheet pages include placeholder data. These are formatted in red, so that
they visually can be identified as placeholders. By including these placeholder data,
the researcher can see an example of the format that you expect to be used in recording
data in this file. Once the project template is copied, the researcher will replace
these data with the real data, and then change the font color to black to indicate that
the placeholder data have been replaced (Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:replacingplaceholdermetadata">2.34</a>).</p>

<p>Another sheet of this spreadsheet allows the researcher to record the details of

(Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:replacingplaceholdertreatment2">2.35</a>). A similar format is used in the
template file to record data from the experiment, including the weights of each animal
over each week of treatment and the final bacterial load in each animal at the end
of treatment. Again, there are placeholder values in the template file, which the
researcher will replace with real data after copying the project template for a new
experiment.</p>

<p>The project template also includes a file that provides a template to create a report
based on the data from the experiment. This file is created using the RMarkdown format,
which combines text with executable code. You can create this template so that it
inputs the experimental data from the file formats created for the data recording
files in the project template. By doing this, the researcher should be able to “knit”
this report for a new experiment, and it should recreate the report based on the
data recorded for that experiment (Figure <a href="2.8-module8.html#fig:makingareport">2.40</a>). By knitting
this template report, you can create a nicely formatted version of the report for

<hr />
<p>As a reminder,
this example set of studies covers a group of studies to explore novel
treatments for tuberculosis. Each study investigates how mice that are
challenged with tuberculosis respond to different treatments, both in terms of
how well they handle the treatment (assessed by checking if their weight
decreases notably while on treatment) and also how well the treatment manages to
limit the growth of tuberculosis in the mouse’s lungs.</p>
<p>We will walk through the process of creating a project directory template that could
be used to manage and analyze data from any of the specific studies in this set of
studies. We’ll cover two ways that you could do this. The first is simpler—it involves
creating a basic file directory with the desired template files and file directory
structure and then copying this file directory every time you want to start a new
project for a study in this set of studies. The second way is a bit more complex and
time-consuming to set up, but has the benefit of providing a very nice interface for
members of your laboratory group to use when they start a new project. This second way
is to create a full R Project template that can be accessed from RStudio anytime you
create a new R Project. This type of template may not be worth the extra set-up time
for project types that your research group only uses rarely, but for types of projects
that your group conducts time and time again, it can be a powerful way to enforce a common
project directory structure, and this in turn will allow your group to create reusable
tools that work in coordination with this project structure.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-and-using-a-basic-template" class="section level3" number="2.8.10">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.10</span> Creating and using a basic template</h3>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the more basic way to create a project template. This involves
no fancy tools—in fact, it’s so straightforward that at first it might seem to simple
to be useful. For this basic approach, you will create an example file directory that
includes template files and that captures you desired project directory structure, and
then members of your group will copy and rename that template every time they start a
new project of that type.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="2.7-module7.html#fig:basicprojecttemplateuse">2.26</a> gives a basic walk-through of the
simple steps you’ll use to start a new project directory once you’ve created
this type of template. First, you will find the project directory template in
your computer’s file system, copy it to where you’d like to save the files for
the new project, and rename the directory to your new project’s name. At this
point, you can use RStudio to make this directory an RStudio Project. Next,
you’ll open the data collection template files and replace the placeholder
example data in the template (shown in red font) with the real data from your
study. The placeholder data can help you remember the format you should use to
record the real data. Finally, once you’ve recorded the data for the study or
experiment, you can open the example report template file. If you’ve designed
this report template well, it should run with the new data you’ve recorded to
create a report for the experiment. At this stage, you can add to the report
or customize it for the new project by changing the Rmarkdown file and re-rendering
it to update the report.</p>

<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 2.55: Steps in using a basic project directory template that you have created for a type of study or experiment.
</p>
</div>
<p>There are a few steps you’ll need to take to create this type of basic project directory
template:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>List the data you typically collect or files you create for that type of study or experiment</li>
<li>Create template files for any data collection that is typical for that type of study
or experiment. Use example or placeholder data to create examples of those files.</li>
<li>Create a directory structure that divides the types of files into subdirectories of similar
types.</li>
<li>Create one or more templates of report files that access and report on the data in the
project template</li>
</ol>
<p>In modules [x], we showed how you can create tidy data collection templates to use to
collect data, and how these can be paired with reproducible reporting tools to separate
the steps of data collection and reporting (modules [x] go into much more depth on these
reproducible reporting tools). Once you have decided on the types of data that you will
usually collect for the type of study that this template is for, you can use that process
to create tidy data collection templates for each type of data.</p>
<p>In addition to the data that you record in the laboratory by hand, the type of study may
also typically have data that’s generated and recorded by laboratory equipment. For example,
the type of study may often include data collected from flow cytometry, to measure certain
cell populations in samples, or from mass spectometry, to measure levels of certain molecules.
For these data, the recording format will typically be determined by the equipment, and
so you won’t need to create data collection templates for the data. However, you should store
these data files in your project directory as well, where they are easy to access and integrate
with other data as you analyze the data for the study.</p>
<p>The recorded data files and the files that come directly from equipment can all be considered
raw data files. In addition, you may typically create some files with pre-processed data.
For example, if you have sequencing data [?], you may initially get large [what type] files
from the [what type] equipment. You may use a program like [what] to pre-process these files
to [do what]. In addition to saving the raw [what type] data files, you’ll also want to
save the processed data files in your project directory, since these are the files that you’ll
analyze and integrate with other data from the project.</p>
<p>Once you have determined the types of files that you’ll normally include in your
project, you can decide how to organize them into subdirectories in a project
file directory. As you do this, it will be helpful to have example or template
files for each file type. For data that you will record yourself, these can be
the templates that you developed to collect the data in a tidy format (modules
[x]), while for data from equipment, these can just be one or more example files
from the equipment that you have collected for a past project. Having these example files
will help you to develop a template project report that can input the type of data that
you typically collect for this type of project.</p>
<p>For the example set of studies for this module, there are a few types of data
that we plan to typically collect for each study. First, we will be recording
metadata for each experiment. This will include a study ID, as well as details
like the mouse strain that we used in that experiment, the route used to
administer the treatment, the treatments per week and total weeks of treatment,
the inoculum used for the challenge, and so on. Second, we’ll be recording some
details about each experimental group that was tested. This includes the drug or
drugs that were tested, doses of each, and some exact details about the
treatment regimen for that group. Both of these types of data can be recorded at
the beginning of the study. Two other types of data will also be recorded, both
of them during the study rather than at the start. The first is weights of the
mice each week. These weights will be recorded for each treatment group each
week of treatment, to help see if there are drugs that are poorly tolerated by
the mice (which can show up through weight decreases in mice in that group). The
second is the bacterial load in the lungs of each mouse at the end of the
treatment period.</p>
<p>To create the project directory template for these studies, then, we’ll create
data collection templates for each of these types of data. We’ll create a
separate spreadsheet for each type of data, but we can group them into files if
we’d like. In our example, we created two files to store this type of data, one
for the metadata that are recorded at the start of the experiment (overall
experiment details and the details of each tested treatment) and one for the
data that are collected over the course of the experiment (mouse weights and
bacterial loads). Within each file, we’ve used separate sheets to record the
different types of data. This allows us to keep similar types of data together
in the same file, while having a tidy collection format for each specific type
of data. [Figure]</p>

<img src="figures/project_data_collection.png" alt="Data collection templates for the example project directory template. These templates were created in two files, one for metadata, which is saved in the main directory of the project, and one for data collected in the laboratory during the experiment, which is saved in the 'data' subdirectory.

<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 2.56: Data collection templates for the example project directory template. These templates were created in two files, one for metadata, which is saved in the main directory of the project, and one for data collected in the laboratory during the experiment, which is saved in the ‘data’ subdirectory. Each file is saved as a spreadsheet file, with two sheets in each file to store different types of data.
</p>
</div>
<p>All of these data collection files are designed using the principles of tidy data
collection (modules [x]). This will ensure that it will be easy to read these
recorded data in a programming language like R for analysis and visualization.
Specifically, when we designed these template files, we thought a lot about
things like using a two-dimensional structure (one row of header names and then
values within each of the columns), using column names that would be easy for
a programming language to parse (e.g., no special characters or spaces in the
column names), and so on.</p>
<p>Now that we have these data collection templates for this type of study, we can
decide how to organize the project directory into subdirectories with the different
types of data. In this case, we’ll use a simple structure. We’ll save the metadata
file in the top level of the project directory, since it provides metadata on the
project as a whole. For the data that are collected during the experiment, we’ll
move that data collection file into a subdirectory called “data”, with its own
subdirectory for “recorded_data” (indicating that we recorded it by hand in the
laboratory). If you had other types of data, you could create other subdirectories
for each type. For example, you could have a “flow_data” subdirectory for data
collected through flow cytometry.</p>
<p>If you had raw data that required pre-processing, you could create
subdirectories both for the raw data and for the processed data that result from
pre-processing steps. For example, if you had data from [RNA sequencing?], you might
have [initial files] and [processed files], as well as a [bash?] script that you used
to generate the processed files from the initial raw data. You could create a directory
called “raw_data” to use to store both the initial raw data and the script used to
process that data, then a “rna_seq_data” subdirectory in the “data” subdirectory to
store the smaller pre-processed files.</p>

</div>
<p>With the previous steps, you will have determined the types of files you normally
have for this type of study, as well as structured the project directory to organize
these files. The next step is to create a template report. You can create this using
tools for reproducible reports—in R, a key tool for this is RMarkdown. Here, we’ll
cover using this tool for creating a report briefly, but there are many more details
in modules [x].</p>
<p>When it comes to project directories, it turns out that you can use the
directory structure in your favor when you create script-based reports, like
RMarkdown reports. There are functions in R, for example, that will allow you to
print all the files in a specified subdirectory. Say that you have several flow
cytometry files in a subdirectory of the “data” subdirectory called “flow_data”.
You could use this function in R to create a list of all the files in that
subdirectory, and then you can run other functions to do the same operations on
all of those files.</p>
<p>When you create a project directory template, we recommend that you create a
subdirectory named something like “reports” to use to store any Rmarkdown report
files for the project. This organization will make it clear where you’ve stored your
reports in the project directory. You’ll be able to use file and directory pathnames
to access all the data in the project, so it will be easy to use the study’s data
in the report even if they’re in separate subdirectories. There’s only one tool
you’ll need to do this—you’ll need to learn how to use relative pathnames
within R code to access files in a different part of your project directory.</p>
<p>A pathname gives the directions to a file that is stored somewhere, for example
on your computer or a server. There are two ways to state a pathname—you can
state it as either an absolute pathname or a relative pathname. An absolute
pathname gives the directions to the file from the root directory of the
computer where it’s stored. In other words, it gives the directions starting
from the very earliest point in the file directory for that computer. A relative
pathname, on the other hand, gives the directions to the file from something
called the current working directory—that is, the directory that your current
program is currently operating from.</p>
<p>You have likely already used relative pathnames extensively. If you read in a file
to a statistical program like R or Python, if that file is in the current working
directory, you only have to give its file name to point the program to the file.
You may not have realized it, but in this case, you were using the simplest type of
relative pathname—since the file is already in your working directory, you
don’t need to give directions that move through different directories to get from
your current working directory to the file.</p>
<p>If you have a file in a subdirectory of the current working directory, you can
use a relative pathname to access it by giving the direction through the
subdirectories to get to the file. For example, if you want to read in a file
named “bacterial_counts.xlsx” that is in a subdirectory of the current working
directory called “data”, you could point to that file using the relative
pathname “data/bacterial_counts.xlsx”. Instead, if you want to point to a file
with the same name that’s in a subdirectory called “reported_data” of the “data”
subdirectory, you’d use the relative pathname
“data/reported_data/bacterial_counts.xlsx”.</p>
<p>You can use relative pathnames to navigate, too, to files that aren’t in a
subdirectory for the current file. To do this, you can use [abbreviations?]
for filenames. One of the most useful is “.”, which stands for the parent
(i.e., one above) the current working directory. For example, if you have
a project directory, and you’ve put an RMarkdown file in the “reports”
subdirectory, but within the code in that file you want to read in data from
the “data” subdirectory of the same project, you could do so with a relative
pathname like “./data/bacterial_counts.xlsx”. This pathname says to move up
one directory from the current working directory (in other words, to the
directory that the current work directory is a subdirectory of) and then
look for a different subdirectory of that parent directory called “data”,
then read a file from that subdirectory.</p>
<p>This strategy is necessary when you’re using RMarkdown for your reports
and have created a project directory template with different subdirectories
for your data versus your reports. In an RMarkdown document, the code will
run using the directory where the RMarkdown file is stored as the working
directory [correct even with Projects?]. Therefore, if you organize your
project directory in the type of structure we’ve recommended, then you’ll
need to use this type of relative pathname to access data elsewhere in
the project directory when you write code for the report.</p>
<p>We can take a look at how this works in the project directory template we
created for the example set of studies. In module [x] we gave details on
what is included in the template report for this project directory template.
Briefly, it is a file that will generate a couple of tables with metadata
on the experiment (overall experiment details as well as details on each
of the treatments), then a graph showing mouse weights over time, then a
graph showing the bacterial load at the end of the study in mice grouped
by treatment, and finally a table giving the results of comparing the
bacterial load in each treatment group to the bacterial load in the control
group.</p>
<p>We created an Rmarkdown file that does this analysis and visualization and
included it in the project template directory. This means that the report file
will be copied and available each time someone copies the project template
directory at the start of a new project. We wrote the code in a way that will
input data that are stored in the data collection files that also come with the
project directory template. Since we named those files in the directory
template, we can refer to them with the same name in the code for the report. We
wrote the code in the report in a way that it will still run if there are more
or fewer observations in any of the data collection files, so the report
template has some flexibility in terms of how each study in the set of studies
might vary. For example, in the example set of studies, some of the experiments
were run using only a control group of mice, while others were run to test as
many as [x] different treatment groups. The report template can accommodate
these differences across studies in the set of studies.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In many cases, you may have a more complex design for your project directory. For
example, if you were collecting flow cytometry data for the project as well, then
you would want a subdirectory in the project that is specifically designed to
store files from the flow cytometry component of the experiment. This subdirectory
would likely include several files, rather than just one. Further, you would not
know ahead of time what the name of these files would be (as you do with the data
collection template files that are included in the template directory). However,
you can still easily write code for a template report file that will work with
multiple files of a similar type, even if you don’t know what the names will be,
as long as you know what the name of their subdirectory will be. There are functions
in R like <code>list.files</code> that can be used to list all the file names for the files
in a given directory. You can use this function to create a vector of all the file
names. For example, you could run:</p>
<p>to get an object (<code>flow_filepaths</code>) that lists each of the filepaths for the files
stored in the “flow_data” subdirectory within the “data” subdirectory of the
project. You could then “map” a function or group of functions across these
files to read them in, process them, and join them into a single dataframe in R.
By using this process, you can write template code in the report for the project
that should work in most cases for the data that you collect for a given type of
study.</p>
<p>The report template is included in the project directory template, so it will be
copied and available for you to use anytime you start a new project using that
template. However, you are not obligated to keep the report identical to the template.
Instead, the template report serves as a starting point, and you can add to it or
adapt it as you work on a study.</p>
<p>For example, in our example template report, we’ve included the results of
applying a statistical test that compares each treatment group to the control
group. Instead, for a specific study of this type, you may want to control
treatments against each other. For example, some of the studies in this example
set of studies include a positive control group, where the mice are treated with
a drug that is already in common use for the disease. In some cases, the
researcher may want to control the bacterial load in groups treated with a novel
drug to groups treated with the positive control. You could easy add to the
report template in that case, adding statistical tests where you compare
different treatment groups to each other.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.8.11</span> Creating an R Project template</h3>
<p>In the previous section, we covered a very basic way to make a project directory
template: you make an example directory of project files, and then anytime you
start a project for that type of study, you copy, rename, and use that example
directory as a template.</p>
<p>There is a second way to make project templates for your research group. This
method requires a lot more work at the beginning. However, it makes it very easy
for anyone in your group to use the template once it’s been created. This method
is to create an R Studio Project template. To be clear, with the basic method
covered in the last chapter, you can create a project directory based on you
basic template and then convert it to an RStudio Project within RStudio.
However, with this second method, you will gain the option to create a new
project based on your template from within RStudio, and many of the details of
creating the template are encapsulated within the process, so you’re more likely
to be able to enforce a common project directory structure across projects.</p>
<p>This method does require a good bit of familiarity with R programming, as it
requires you to create a new R package. In this section, we’ll go over the
process, using the example set of studies for this module as a motivating
example. …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There are several steps that you’ll take to create the RStudio Project
template:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Decide on project directory structure</li>
<li>Create templates for recording data</li>
<li>Create a template for a report for the project</li>
<li>Create an R package to implement the Project template</li>
<li>Move the templates for data recording and the report into the “inst”
directory of the Project package</li>
<li>Write code in the package to create project structure and copy in templates</li>
<li>Customize the Project Wizard for the Project in the package code</li>
<li>Build the Project template package and share it with your research group</li>
</ol>
<p>Several of these are the same as the steps to create a basic project directory
template. Specifically, steps 1–3 are the same steps that you would take to
create a basic project directory template.</p>
<p>The novel steps for this process come from step 4 and later. Rather than
creating a file directory that your research group will copy and rename, we’ll
put all the elements of the project template within an R package that you can
build and then share with your research group. They will be able to install this
package, and then whenever they start a project, they will be able to initialize
it as this special type of project from within RStudio, as described in the
previous module.</p>
<p>Under this method, the template is put together and shared as an R package. An R
package is a collection of R code and data that extend the functionality of base
R. If you have coded with R, you’ve likely used these types of packages to get
access to useful functions. For example, the “tidyverse” (module [x]) is a suite
of popular R packages with functions for working with data. Anyone can create
and share an R package, either broadly and publicly by submitting it to a
repository like Bioconductor (in which case it will need to follow some
additional constraints and pass some checks) or privately as a compressed file
that anyone you share it with can download to their computer and install.</p>
<p>The new steps in this process start with step 4, which is to create an R package
to implement the Project template. You can create the framework for an R package
very easily in R study. Open RStudio, go to “File”, and select “New Project”, as
you would if you were creating any type of RStudio Project. Choose “New Directory”,
but then instead of choosing the generic “New Project”, choose “R Package”. This
will create an open a new Project directory for you package, one that includes
templates for many of the files that you need to start a new R package. (As a note,
this is using a special R project template, just like you’ll be creating!)</p>
<p>[More on the initial package directory]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For most R packages, you create them to use to share new R functions.
Therefore, the package directory is focused on new R scripts. However,
the R package structure is very flexible, and it can be effectively used
to share other things as well. For example, R packages can be created
to share datasets, with very few or no new functions included. Similarly,
the R package that we’ll make with your template will allow you to share
a directory structure and some “starter” files to go into that structure,
rather than R code.</p>
<p>Since we’re using the R package structure for this alternative use, it may
at first seem a bit confusing why we need to put certain files in certain
places or write code that moves files around. Briefly, R packages are
created and shared essentially as file directories, but these file
directories must follow a very specific structure, with specific names
for different subdirectories and files within the structure. We’ll need
to follow these rules as we organize the template files within our R package
for our Project template. We will explain as we move through this section
where you should save everything in your R package directory, but this is
just to clarify that there is a reason that the structure might seem a
bit convoluted—we’re leveraging a structure normally meant for a bit of
a different use.</p>
<p>You can make as many template files as you’d like to include in your Project
template. When you make the R project with your template, you’ll store these all
in a special directory that you should call “inst”. In an R package, the “inst”
directory can act as a bit of a catch-all, where you can store files that you
would like to be included when someone installs your package, but that don’t
naturally fit in another part of the package directory.</p>
<p>Within this “inst” subdirectory, you can create as many subdirectories as you’d
like, to help you organize your template files. The only rule is that there are
a handful of names that you should avoid for these subdirectory names. This is
because, when the package is installed, all the subdirectories in this “inst”
subdirectory will be moved up to the main package directory, and so you should
avoid directory names that have a specific meaning in an R package. Namely, you
should avoid naming any subdirectories in the “inst” subdirectory any of the
following: “data”, “R”, “src”, “man”, “demo”, “tests”, “exec”, “po”, “tools”,
“vignettes” [?], “build” [?], “share” [?], “licenses” [?].</p>
<p>In the template for the example set of studies for this module, for example, we
created three subdirectories in the “inst” subdirectory to use to store
templates for this type of Project: “data_collection_templates”, where we stored
an Excel file with the template for collecting data during each experiment
(i.e., the mice weights and final bacterial loads), “metadata_templates”, which
includes an Excel file with the template for collecting metadata on the
experiment on a whole and on each of the tested treatments, and
“report_templates”, where we stored an RMarkdown file with the template report
for the project. For any templates that include code, keep in mind that you’ll
need to be careful in setting the pathnames to access any data in the project
directory. [More on this?]</p>
<p>Once you’ve added any templates to the “inst” directory, the next step is to
write code in the template package. For this type of package, which aims to
set up a new Project structure, you’ll only include R code for one purpose—the
R code will run when someone first opens a new Project of this type, and it
will operate to set up the initial project structure. R can be used to do
many different things—while you may have mostly used it before to read in and
analyze data, it can also be used to do things like make new directories on
you computer, or to copy files from one place in your computer’s file directory
to another. We’ll be using these types of commands in this template R package,
as it will allow us to move the template files that you created into the
right place in a user’s new project directory when they chose to use your
template to make a new project.</p>
<p>There are four key R functions that we’ll be using to do these tasks. The first
is the <code>dir.create</code> function. This can be used to create new directories on
the user’s computer. You can include the name that you’d like to use as the
new subdirectory. We’ll use this function to create the subdirectories in the
new project, and so this function will let us create a structure within the
user’s subdirectory.</p>
<p>The second key R function that we’ll use is <code>file.copy</code>. This function allows
us to copy a file from one place in the user’s computer to another spot. When
the user installs our package, all of the template files will be included with
that installation. With <code>file.copy</code>, we’ll be able to copy these template files
into the right spot on each user’s computer each time they open a new Project
with this template.</p>
<p>The third key R function also helps with this process of copying the template
files. In order to copy the files, we need to be able to find where they’re
stored on the user’s computer. Since they’ve been installed with the package,
the template files will be located on the user’s computer based on where that
user stores their installed R packages. This location can differ by user,
but fortunately there’s a function called <code>system.file</code> that lets us figure out
the file path for any file that’s stored in an R package that the user has
installed, on that user’s computer. This function will therefore allow us to
get the original filepath for each of the template files, so we can copy them
into the new Project.</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth key R function is <code>file.path</code>. This function can create a
file path, and it’s helpful because it can allow you to write code that will
generate the full path to a file or subdirectory on the user’s computer, based
on the relationship of that file or subdirectory to the working directory of the
project they’ve created. We’ll use this function, for example, to create the
file path for the new subdirectories that should go in the Project when the user
opens it. Even though each user could be storing their project in a different
part of their computer’s file directory, this function can determine the path we
should use for each subcomponent in the project.</p>
<p>[How to create directories and move in the template files]</p>
<p>Using these functions, we’ll create the subdirectory structure of the project
and then move any template files into the right place in that structure. This
will happen in an R function—in many cases, this might be the only R function
that you’ll include in the package that defines the Project template. You
can name this R function anything you’d like (later, we’ll show how you can
connect this function so that it’s automatically run when someone makes their
new Project with the template). You should save the code for the function in the
R subdirectory of your package directory.</p>
<p>In the example for this module, we’ve named the function <code>create_project</code> and
stored the code for it in a file called “create_project.R” in the R
subdirectory of our package. This function should take at least two inputs:
<code>path</code>, which will be the filepath to the project’s directory, and <code>...</code>
(which we’ll call “dots”), which allows other arguments to pass into the
function.</p>
<p>Within the function, we’ve included code that will create all the subdirectories
for this type of project, as well as code that moves the template files into the
right place in those subdirectories. First, …</p>
<p>[How to customize the Project Wizard for the project]</p>
<p>As you work on the package, you can build it and test it on your own computer.
If you are working in RStudio, you can use a “Build” Pane that is available
when you’re working on a R Project that is a package. In this pane, there
is a “Install and Reload” button [doublecheck]—if you click this button,
it will build the package and install it on your computer in the same
place that other R packages are installed (for example, packages that you
install from CRAN).</p>
<p>Once you’ve built and installed your package, give it a try. You can go
up to the “File” menu in RStudio and select “New Project”. Select
“New Directory”, and this will take you to a menu with the different types
of R Projects you can create. You should now see your Project template
as one of the options. Click on this, and you can test out if the template’s
working like you hoped it would.</p>
<p>[How a different user can download and install a package that isn’t on CRAN]</p>
<p>If you would like to create one of these RStudio Project templates for studies
in your research group, there are more details on the process at … In addition,
since this method requires building an R package, you may find resources on creating
R packages to be useful. One excellent book on the topic, which is available for
free online, is [R Packages] by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.</p>
