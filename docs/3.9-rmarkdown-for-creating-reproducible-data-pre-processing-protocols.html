<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> RMarkdown for creating reproducible data pre-processing protocols</h2>
<p>The R extension package RMarkdown can be used to create documents that combine
code and text in a ‘knitted’ document, and it has become a popular tool for
improving the computational reproducibility and efficiency of the data analysis
stage of research. This tool can also be used earlier in the research process,
however, to improve reproducibility of pre-processing steps. In this module, we
will provide detailed instructions on how to use RMarkdown in RStudio to create
documents that combine code and text. We will show how an RMarkdown document
describing a data pre-processing protocol can be used to efficiently apply the
same data pre-processing steps to different sets of raw data.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define RMarkdown and the documents it can create</li>
<li>Explain how RMarkdown can be used to improve the reproducibility of research
projects at the data pre-processing phase</li>
<li>Create a document in RStudio using RMarkdown</li>
<li>Apply it to several different datasets with the same format</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.9.1</span> Creating knitted documents in R</h3>
<p>In the last module, we described what knitted documents are, as well as the
advantages of using knitted documents to create data pre-processing protocols
for common pre-processing tasks in your research group. In this module, we will
go into more detail about how you can create these documents using R and
RStudio, and in the next module we will walk through an example data
pre-processing protocol created using this method.</p>
<p>R has a special format for creating knitted documents called <strong>Rmarkdown</strong>.
Later in this module, we will provide details on creating these documents, but
first, we will provide some details of some of the specific conventions used in
this type of knitted documents. As with other knitted documents, Rmarkdown
documents are originally written in plain text. In the previous module, we
discussed how knitted documents will use a markup language within the plain text
for formatting; for RMarkdown files, the markup language used is Markdown. Since
the laguage is Markdown, the preamble for each document uses YAML. We described
in the previous module how knitted documents include executable code, along with
the formatted text. By default, executable code for RMarkdown files will be in
R, but there are also options to include executable code in the document in a
number of other programming languages.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.9.2</span> Creating and exploring an Rmarkdown file</h3>
<p><strong>Creating a new Rmarkdown file and exploring the template.</strong></p>
<p>First, we will explain how you can create a new Rmarkdown document using
RStudio. Like other plain text documents, an Rmarkdown file should be edited
using a text editor, rather than a word processor like Word or Google Docs. It
is easiest to use the Rstudio IDE as the text editor when creating and editing
an R markdown document, as this IDE has incorporated some helpful functionality
for working with plain text documents for Rmarkdown. The RStudio IDE can be
downloaded and installed as a free software, as long as you use the personal
version (RStudio creates higher-powered versions for corporate use). Since
RStudio is free and has many helpful tools for working with Rmarkdown, we will
focus on using this interface in our advice in this module.</p>
<p>In RStudio, you can create a number of types of new files through the
“File” menu. To create a new R markdown file, choose “New File” and then choose
“Rmarkdown” from the choices in that menu. Figure <a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdownnewfile">3.8</a>
shows an example of what this menu option looks like.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:rmarkdownnewfile"></span>
<p class="caption marginnote shownote">

</p>
<img src="figures/rmarkdown_newfile.png" alt="RStudio pull-down menus to help you navigate to open a new Rmarkdown file." width="\textwidth"  />
</div>
<p>This will open a window with some options you can specify some of the overall
information about the document (Figure <a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdownchoices">3.9</a>), including
the title and the author, and you can specify the output format that you would
like. Possible output formats include HTML, Word, and PDF. You should be able to
use the HTML and Word output formats without any additional software. If you
would like to use the PDF output, you will need to install one other piece of
software: Miktex for Windows, MacTex for Mac, or TeX Live for Linux. These are
all pieces of software with an underlying TeX engine and all are open-source and
free.</p>

</div>
<p>Once you have selected the options in this menu you can choose the “Okay” button
(Figure <a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdownchoices">3.9</a>). This will open a new document. This
document, however, won’t be blank. Instead it will include an example document
written in Rmarkdown (Figure <a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdowntemplate">3.10</a>). This example
document helps you navigate how the Rmarkdown process works, by letting you test
out a sample document. It also gives you a starting point—once you understand
how the example document works, you can edit it and change it to convert it
into the document you would like to create.</p>

</div>
<p>If you have not used Rmarkdown before, it is very helpful to try knitting this
example document before making changes, to explore how pieces in the document
align with elements in the rendered output document. Once you are
familiar with the line-up between elements in this file in the output document,
you delete parts of the example file and insert your own text and code.</p>
<p>We will walk you through exploring this example document, as well as aligning it
with the formatted output document (Figure <a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">3.11</a>).
First, to render this or any Rmarkdown document, if you are in RStudio you can
use the “Knit” button at the top of the file, as shown in Figure
<a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdowntemplate2">3.12</a>. When you click on this button, it will render the
entire document to the output format you’ve selected (HTML, PDF, or Word). This
rendering process will both run the executable code and apply all formatting.
The final output (Figure <a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">3.11</a>, right) will pop up
in a new window. As you start with Rmarkdown, it is useful to look at this
output to see how it compares with the plain text Rmarkdown file (Figure
<a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">3.11</a>, left).</p>

</div>
<p>You will also notice, after you first render the document, that your working
directory has a new file with this output document. For example, if you are
working to create an HTML document using an Rmarkdown file called
“my_report.Rmd,” once you knit your Rmarkdown file, you will notice a new file
in your working directory called “my_report.html.” This new file is your output
file, the one that you would share with colleagues as a report. You should
consider this output document to be read only—in other words, you can read and
share this document, but you should not make any changes directly to this
document, since they will be overwritten anytime you re-render the original
Rmarkdown document.</p>
<p>Next, let’s compare the example Rmarkdown document (the one that is given when
you first open an Rmarkdown file in RStudio) with the output file that is
created when you render this example document (Figure
<a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">3.11</a>). If you look at the output document (Figure
<a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">3.11</a>, right), you can notice how different elements
align with pieces in the original Rmarkdown file (Figure
<a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdownoriginalfinal">3.11</a>). For example, the output document includes a
header with the text “R Markdown.” This second-level header is created by the
Markdown notation in the original file of:</p>
<pre><code>## R Markdown</code></pre>
<p>This header is formatted in a larger font than other text, and on a separate
line—the exact formatting is specified within the style file for the Rmarkdown
document, and will be applied to all second-level headers in the document. You
can also see formatting specified through things like bold font for the word
“Knit,” through the Markdown syntax <code>**Knit**</code>, and a clickable link specified
through the syntax <code>&lt;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&gt;</code>. At the beginning of the
original document, you can see how elements like the title, author, date, and
output format are specified in the YAML. Finally, you can see that special
character combinations demarcate sections of executable code.</p>
<p><strong>Formatting text with Markdown.</strong></p>
<p>For the main text in an Rmarkdown document, all formatting is done using
Markdown as the markup language. Markdown is a popular markup language, in part
because it is a good bit simpler than other markup languages like HTML or LaTeX.
This simplicity means that it is not quite as expressive as other markup
languages. However, Markdown provides adequate formatting for 90% of the
formatting you will typically want to do for a research report or
pre-processeing protocol, and by staying simpler, it is much easier to learn the
Markdown syntax quickly compared to other markup languages.</p>
<p>As with other markup languages, Markdown uses special characters or combinations of characters to indicate formatting within the plain text of the original document. When the document is rendered, these markings are used by the software to create the formatting that you have specified in the final output document. Some example formatting symbols and conventions for Markdown include:</p>
<ul>
<li>to format a word or phrase in bold, surround it with two asterisks (<code>**</code>)</li>
<li>to format a word or phrase in italics, surround it with one asterisk (<code>*</code>)</li>
<li>to create a first-level header, put the header text on its own line, starting the line with <code>#</code></li>
<li>to create a second-level header, put the header text on its own line, starting the line with <code>##</code></li>
<li>separate paragraphs with empty lines</li>
<li>use hyphens to create bulleted lists</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to keep in mind when using Markdown, in terms of formatting, is that
white space can be very important in specifying the formatting. For example when
you specify a new paragraph, you must leave a blank line from your previous
text. Similarly when you use a hash (<code>#</code>) to indicate a header, you must leave a
blank space after the hash before the word or phrase that you want to be used in
that header. To create a section header, you would write:</p>
<pre><code># Initial Data Inspection</code></pre>
<p>Meanwhile this:</p>
<pre><code>#Initial Data Inspection</code></pre>
<p>Would render to:</p>
<p>#Initial Data Inspection</p>
<p>Similarly, white space is needed to separate paragraphs. For example, this would create two paragraphs:</p>
<pre><code>This is a first paragraph. 

This is a second.</code></pre>
<p>Meanwhile this would create one:</p>
<pre><code>This is a first paragraph.
This is still part of the first paragraph.</code></pre>
<p>The syntax of Markdown is fairly simple and can be learned quickly. For more
details on this syntax, you can refer to the Rmarkdown reference guide at
<a href="https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf" class="uri">https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf</a>. The
basic formatting rules for Markdown are also covered any number of more
extensive resources for Rmarkdown that we will point you to later in this
module.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a preamble with YAML.</strong></p>
<p>In the previous module, we explained how knitted documents include a
preamble to specify some metadata about the document, including elements
like the title, authors, and output format. In R, this preamble is
created using YAML. In this subsection, we provide some more details
on using this YAML section in Rmarkdown documents.</p>
<p>When you initially create an Rmarkdown document, you select the output format
for it (e.g., pdf, Word, HTML). You can change this output selection once you’ve
created the document, however, by making a change in a special section at the
top of the RMarkdown document called the “YAML.” The YAML is a special section
at the top of an RMarkdown document (the original, plain text file, not the
rendered version). It is set off from the rest of the document using a special
combination of characters, using a process very similar to how executable code
is set off from other text with a special set of characters so it can be easily
identified by the software program that renders the document. For the YAML, this
combination of characters is three hyphens (<code>---</code>) on a line by themselves to
start the YAML section and then another three on a line by themselves to end it.
Here is an example of what the YAML might look like at the top of an RMarkdown
document:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: &quot;Laboratory report for example project&quot;
author: &quot;Brooke Anderson&quot;
date: &quot;1/12/2020&quot;
output: word_document
---</code></pre>
<p>Within the YAML itself, you can specify different options for your document.
You can change simple things like the title, author, and date, but you can
also change more complex things, including how the output document is rendered.
For each thing that you want to specify, you specify it with a special
keyword for that option and then a valid choice for that keyword. The idea
is very similar to setting parameter values in a function call in R. For
example, the <code>title:</code> keyword is a valid one in RMarkdown YAML. It allows you
to set the words that will be printed in the title space, using title formatting,
in your output document. It can take any string of characters, so you can put in
any text for the title that you’d like, as long as you surround it with quotation
marks. The <code>author:</code> and <code>date:</code> keywords work in similar ways. The <code>output:</code>
keyword allows you to specify the output that the document should be rendered to.
In this case, the keyword can only take one of a few set values, including
<code>word_document</code> to output a Word document, <code>pdf_document</code> to output a pdf
document (see later in this section for some more set-up required to make that
work), and <code>html_document</code> to output an HTML document.</p>
<p>As you start using RMarkdown, you will be able to do a lot without messing with
the YAML much. In fact, you can get a long way without ever changing the values
in the YAML from the default values they are given when you first create an
RMarkdown document. As you become more familiar with R, you may want to learn
more about how the YAML works and how you can use it to customize your
document—it turns out that quite a lot can be set in the YAML to do very
interesting customizations in your final rendered document. The book <em>R
Markdown: The Definitive Guide</em> [ref], which is available free online, has
sections discussing YAML choices for both HTML and pdf output, at
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html</a> and
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html</a>, respectively. There is
also a talk that Yihui Xie, the creator of RMarkdown, gave on this topic at a
past RStudio conference, available at
<a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2017/customizing-extending-r-markdown/" class="uri">https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2017/customizing-extending-r-markdown/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Executable code in Rmarkdown files.</strong></p>
<p>In the previous module, we described how knitted documents use special markers
to indicate where sections of executable code start and stop. In RMarkdown,
the markers you will use to indicate executable code look like this:</p>
<pre><code>```r{}
my_object &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)
```</code></pre>
<p>The first part of this marker (<code>```{r}</code>) indicates that a section of
code is starting. Then end part (<code>```</code>) indicates that the file is
moving back to regular Markdown. In the first marker, you can use the simplest
form (<code>```{r}</code>) to indicate the start of the code. However, you can also
include options to customize actions when the code in that section is executed.
There are many options that you can set for each code chunk. These options will
specify how the code in that section of executable code will be run and how the
output from running the code will be presented. These specifications are called
<strong>chunk options</strong>, and you specify them in the special character combination
where you mark the start of executable code. For example, you can specify that
the code should be printed in the document, but not executed, by setting the
<code>eval</code> parameter to <code>FALSE</code> with <code>```{r eval = FALSE}</code> as the marker to
start the code section.</p>
<p>The chunk options also include <code>echo</code>, which can be used to specify whether to
print the code in that code chunk when the document is rendered. For some
documents, it is useful to print out the code that is executed, where for other
documents you may not want that printed. For example, for a pre-processing
protocol, you are aiming to show yourself and others how the pre-processing was
done. In this case, it is very helpful to print out all of the code, so that
future researchers who read that protocol can clearly see each step. By
contrast, if you are using Rmarkdown to create a report or an article that is
focused on the results of your analysis, it may make more sense to instead hide
the code in the final document.</p>
<p>As part of the code options, you can also specify whether messages and warnings
created when running the code should be included in the document output, and
there are number of code chunk options that specify how tables and figures
rendered by the code should be shown. For more details on the possible options
that can be specified for how code is evaluated within an executable chunk of
code, you refer to the Rmarkdown cheat sheet available at
<a href="https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf" class="uri">https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf</a></p>
<p>RStudio has some functionality that is useful when you are working with code in
Rmarkdown documents. Within each code chuck are some buttons that can be used to
test out the code in that chunk of executable code. One is the green right arrow
key to the right at the top of the code chunk, highlighted in Figure
<a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rmarkdowntemplate2">3.12</a>. This button will run all of the code in that
chunk and show you the output in an output field that will open directly below
the code chunk. This functionality allows you to explore the code in your
document as you build it, rather than waiting until you are ready to render the
entire document. The button directly to the left of that button, which looks
like an upward-pointing arrow over a rectangle, will execute all code that comes
before this chunk in the document. This can be very helpful in making sure that
you have set up your environment to run this particular chunk of code.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.9.3</span> More advanced Rmarkdown functionality</h3>
<p>The details and resources that we have covered so far focus on the basics of
Rmarkdown. You can get a lot done just with these basics. However, the Rmarkdown
system is very rich and allows complex functionality beyond these basics. In
this subsection, we will highlight just a few of the ways Rmarkdown can be used
in a more advanced way. Since this topic is so broad, we will focus on elements
that we have found to be particularly useful for biomedical researchers as they
become more advanced Rmarkdown users. For the most part, we will not go into
extensive detail about how to use these more advanced features in this module,
but instead point to resources where you can learn more as you are ready. If you
are just learning Rmarkdown, at this point it will be helpful to just know that
some of these advanced features are available, so you can come back and explore
them when you become familiar with the basics. However, we will provide more
details for two elements that we find particularly useful in creating data
pre-processing protocols: including bibliographical references and including
mathematical equations. In the next module, we walk through an example of using
RMarkdown, and in this example we show how you can use these two more advanced
features when creating a pre-processing protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Including bibliographical references.</strong></p>
<p>You can use Rmarkdown, in combination with something called BibTeX, as a
referencing system. This allows you to include bibliographical references in the
documents that you create, and Rmarkdown will handle the creation of the
references section and the numbering of the documents within your text.</p>
<p>To include references in RMarkdown documents, you can use something called
<strong>BibTeX</strong>. This has three components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a plain text file with listings for each of
your references (<strong>BibTeX file</strong>). Save it with the
extension <code>.bib</code>.</li>
<li>In your RMarkdown document, include the filepath
to this BibTeX file.</li>
<li>In the text of the RMarkdown file, include a key and special character
combination anytime you want to reference a paper.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have a BibTeX file, you will include its
path in the YAML:</p>
<pre><code>  ---
  title: &quot;Reproducible Research with R&quot;
  author: &quot;Brooke Anderson&quot;
  date: &quot;1/25/2021&quot;
  output: beamer_presentation
  bibliography: mybibliography.bib
  ---</code></pre>
<p>It is easiest if you save the BibTeX file in the same directory
as the RMarkdown document.</p>
<p>You can add references in the text using a key for each paper
within special characters (<code>[@paper1, @paper2]</code>).</p>
<p>For example, you would write:</p>
<pre><code>This technique follows earlier work [@fox2020, 
@anderson2019].</code></pre>
<p>To create:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>``This technique follows earlier work (Fox et al. 2020, Anderson et al. 2019)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With full paper details included at the end of the document.</p>
<p>Put all the bibliographical details in the BibTeX file:</p>
<p>You will have a file named something like <code>mybibliography.bib</code>
with entries for each paper like this:</p>
<pre><code>@article{fox2020,
  title={Cyto-feature engineering: A pipeline for flow cytometry 
    analysis to uncover immune populations and associations with 
    disease},
  author={Fox, Amy and Dutt, Taru S and Karger, Burton and Rojas, 
    Mauricio and Obreg{\&#39;o}n-Henao, Andr{\&#39;e}s and 
    Anderson, G Brooke and Henao-Tamayo, Marcela},
  journal={Scientific Reports},
  volume={10},
  number={1},
  pages={1--12},
  year={2020}
}</code></pre>
<p>You can get these details from Google Scholar:</p>

</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Including mathematical equations.</strong></p>
<p>Next, you can include mathematical equations within an
Rmarkdown document. This allows you to use nice formatting whenever you need
to include an equation within your document.</p>
<p>You can include math using a system developed for specifying mathematical
equations in LaTeX. [Add more on math]</p>
<p><strong>Including executable code in other languages.</strong></p>
<p>In your RMarkdown documents, you include executable code in special sections
(“chunks”) that are separated from the regular text using a special combination
of characters, as described earlier in this module and in the previous module.
By default, in Rmarkdown files the code in these chunks are executed using the R
programming language. However, you can also include executable code in a number
of other programming languages. For example, you could set some code chunks to
run Python, others to run Julia, and still others (e.g., bash) to run a shell script.</p>
<p>This can be very helpful if you have steps in you Python that use code in
different languages. For example, there may be a module in Python that
works well for an early step in your data preprocessing, and then later
steps that are easier with general R functions. This presents no problem in
creating an RMarkdown data pre-processing protocol, as you can include
different steps using different languages.</p>
<p>The program that is used to run the code in a specific chunk is called the
“engine” for that chunk [ref—R Markdown def guide]. You can change the engine
by changing the combination of characters you use to demarcate the start of
executable code. When you are including a chunk of R code, you mark it off
starting with the character combination <code>```{r}</code>. You change this to
give the engine you would like to use—for example, you would include a chunk
of Python code using <code>```{python}</code> [ref—R Markdown def guide]. When
your RMarkdown document is rendered, your computer will use the specified
software to run each code chunk. Of course, to run that piece of code, your
computer must have that type of software installed and available. For example,
if you include a chunk of code that you’d like to run with a Python engine, you
must have Python on your computer.</p>
<p>While you can use many different software programs as the engine for each code
chunk, there are a few limitations with some programs. For many open-source
software programs, the results from running a chunk of code with that engine
will be available for later code chunks that also use that engine to use as an
input [ref—R Markdown def guide]. This is not the case, however, for most of
the available engines. For example, if you use the SAS software program as the
engine for one of your code chunks, the output from running that code will not
be available to input to later code in the document.</p>
<p><strong>Caching code results.</strong></p>
<p>Some code can take a while to run, particularly if it is processing very large
datasets. By default, RMarkdown will re-run all code in the document every time
you render it. This is usually the best set-up, since it allows you to confirm
that the code is all executing as desired each time the code is rendered.
However, if you have steps that take a long time, this can make it so the
RMarkdown document takes a long time to render each time you render it.</p>
<p>To help with this problem, RMarkdown has a system that allows you to <em>cache</em>
results from some or all code chunks in the document. This is a really nice
system—it will check the inputs to that part of the code each time the
document is run. If those inputs have changed, it will take the time to re-run
that piece of code, to use the updated inputs. However, if the inputs have not
changed since the last time the document was rendered, then the last results for
that chunk of code will be pulled from memory and used, without re-running the
code in that chunk. This saves time most of the times that you render the
document, while taking the time to re-run the code when necessary, because the
inputs have changed and so the outputs may be different.</p>
<p>There are some downsides to caching. For example, caching can increase the
storage space it takes to save Rmarkdown work, as intermediate results are
saved. However, if some of your code is very time-intensive to run, it may make
sense to look into caching options with Rmarkdown. For more on caching with
Rmarkdown documents, see <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cache.html">this
section</a> of the <em>R
Markdown Cookbook</em> [ref].</p>
<p><strong>Outputting to other formats.</strong></p>
<p>You can use RMarkdown to create documents other than traditional reports.
Scientists might find the outputs of presentations and posters particularly
useful.</p>
<p>RMarkdown has allowed a pdf slide output for a long time. This output leverages
the “beamer” format from LaTeX. You can create a series of presentation slides
in RMarkdown, using Markdown to specify formatting, and then the document will
be rendered to pdf slides. These slides can be shown using pdf viewer software,
like Adobe Acrobat, set either to full screen or to the presentation option.
More recently, capability has been added to RMarkdown that allows you to create
PowerPoint slides. Again, you will start from an RMarkdown document, using
Markdown syntax to do things like divide content into separate slides.
Regardless of the output format you choose (pdf slides or PowerPoint), the code
to generate figures and tables in the presentation can be included directly in
the RMarkdown file, so it is re-run with the latest data each time you render
the presentation.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use RMarkdown to create scientific posters, although this
is a bit less common and there are fewer tutorial resources with instructions on
doing this. To find out more about creating scientific posters with Rmarkdown,
you can start by looking at the documentation for some R packages that have been
created for this process. Two include the <code>posterdown</code> package [ref], with
documentation available at
<a href="https://reposhub.com/python/miscellaneous/brentthorne-posterdown.html" class="uri">https://reposhub.com/python/miscellaneous/brentthorne-posterdown.html</a>, and the
<code>pagedown</code> package [ref], with documentation available at
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown" class="uri">https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown</a>. There are also some blog posts available
where researchers describe how they created a poster with Rmarkdown; one
thorough one is “How to make a poster in R” by Wei Yang Tham, available at
<a href="https://wytham.rbind.io/post/making-a-poster-in-r/" class="uri">https://wytham.rbind.io/post/making-a-poster-in-r/</a>.</p>
<p>This idea of customizing Rmarkdown documents has evolved in another useful way
through the idea of Rmarkdown templates. These are templates that are
customized—often very highly customized—while allowing you to write the
content using Rmarkdown. One area where these templates can be very useful to
scientists is with article templates that are customized for specific
scientific journals. A number of scientific journals have created LaTeX
templates that can be used when writing drafts to submit to the journal.
These templates produce a draft that is nicely formatted, following all
the journal’s guidelines for submission, and in some cases formatted as the
final article would be for the journal. These templates have existed for
a long time, particularly for journals in fields in which LaTeX is commonly
used for document formatting, including physics and statistics. However,
the templates traditionally required you to use LaTeX, which is a complex
markup language with a high threshold for learning to use it.</p>
<p>Now, many of these article templates have been wrapped within an Rmarkdown
template, allowing you to leverage them while writing all the content in
Rmarkdown syntax, and allowing you to include executable code directly in the
draft. An example of the first page of an article created in Rmarkdown using
one of these article templates is shown in Figure <a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rticleexample">3.14</a>.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:rticleexample"></span>

Figure 3.14: Example of a manuscript written in Rmarkdown using a templat. This figure shows the first page of an article written for submission to <em>PLoS Computation Biology</em>, written in Rmarkdown while using the <em>PLoS</em> template from the <code>rticles</code> package. The full article, including the Rmarkdown input and final pdf, are available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/cjwendt/plos_ten" class="uri">https://github.com/cjwendt/plos_ten</a>.

</div>
<p>These Rmarkdown templates are typically available through R packages, which you
can install on your computer in the same way you would install any R package
(i.e., with the <code>install.packages</code> function). Many journal article templates are
available through the <code>rticles</code> package [ref], including the template used to
create the manuscript shown in Figure <a href="3.9-rmarkdown-for-creating-reproducible-data-pre-processing-protocols.html#fig:rticleexample">3.14</a>. You can find
more information about the <code>rticles</code> package on its GitHub page, at
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rticles" class="uri">https://github.com/rstudio/rticles</a>. There is also a section in the book <em>R
Markdown: A Definitive Guide</em> [ref] on writing manuscripts for scientific
journals using Rmarkdown, available online at
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rticles-templates.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rticles-templates.html</a>.</p>
<p>You can use RMarkdown to create much larger outputs, compared to simpler reports
and protocols. RMarkdown can now be used to create very large and dynamic
documents, including online books (which can also be rendered to pdf versions
suitable for printing), dashboard-style websites, and blogs. Once members of
your research group are familiar with the basics of RMarkdown, you may want to
explore using it to create these more complex outputs. The book format divides
content into chapters and special sections like appendices and references. It
includes a table of contents based on weblinks, so readers can easily navigate
the content. It uses a book format as its base that allows readers to do things
like change the font size and search the book text for keywords. The book
containing these modules is one example of using bookdown. If you would like to
explore using bookdown to create online books based on Rmarkdown files, there
are a number of resources available. There is an online book available with
extensive instructions on using this package, available at
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/</a>. There is also a helpful website with more
details on this package, <a href="https://bookdown.org/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/</a>. The website include a gallery of
example books created with bookdown <a href="https://bookdown.org/home/archive/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/home/archive/</a>, which
you can use to explore the types of books that can be created.</p>
<p>You can also use Rmarkdown documents to create webpages, with pages included for
blogs. This format allows you to create a very attractive website that includes
a blog section, where you can write and regularly post new blogs, keeping the
site dynamic. It is a nice entry point to developing and maintaining a website
for people who are learning to code in R but otherwise haven’t done much coding,
as you can do all the steps within RStudio. There are templates for these blogs
that are appropriate for creating personal or research group websites for
academics. These websites can be created to highlight the research and people in
your research lab. You can encourage students and postdocs to create personal
sites, to raise the profile of their research. In the past, we have even used
one as a central, unifying spot for a group study, with students contributing
blog posts as their graded assignment
(<a href="https://kind-neumann-789611.netlify.app/" class="uri">https://kind-neumann-789611.netlify.app/</a>). To learn how to create websites with
blogs, you can check the book <em>blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown</em>
[ref], which is available both in print and free online at
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/</a>. This process takes a bit of work to
initially get the website set up, but then allows for easy and straightforward
maintenance.</p>
<p>Finally, a simpler way to make basic web content with RMarkdown is through their
<em>flexdashboard</em> format. This format creates a smaller website that is focused on
sharing data results—you can see a gallery of examples at
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/examples.html" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/examples.html</a>. This format is
excellent for creating a webpage that allows users to view complex, and
potentially interactive, results from data you’ve collected. It can be
particularly helpful for groups that need to quickly communicate regularly
updated data to viewers. During 2020, for example, many public health
departments maintained dashboard-style websites to share evolving data on
COVID-19 in the community. Using RMarkdown in this case has the key advantage of
allowing you to easily update the dashboard webpage as you get new or updated
data, since it is easy to re-run any data processing, analysis, and
visualization code in the document. To learn how to use RMarkdown to create
dashboard websites, you can check out RStudio’s flexdashboard site at
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html</a>. There is also guidance
available in one of the chapters of <em>R Markdown: The Definitive Guide</em> [ref]:
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/dashboards.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/dashboards.html</a>.</p>
<p><strong>More complex formatting.</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Markdown is a fairly simple markup language. Occasionally,
this simplicity means that you might not be able to create fancier formatting
that you might desire. There is a method that allows you to work around this
constraint in RMarkdown.</p>
<p>In Rmarkdown documents, when you need more complex formatting, you can shift
into a more complex markup language for part of the document. Markup languages
like LaTeX and HTML are much more expressive than Markdown, with many more
formatting choices possible. For example, there is functionality within
LaTeX and HTML to create much more complex tables than in Markdown. However,
there is a downside—when you include formatting specified in these
more complex markup languages, you will limit the output formats that you can
render the document to. For example, if you include LaTeX formatting within
an RMarkdown document, you must output the document to PDF, while if you
include HTML, you must output to an HTML file. Conversely, if you stick with
the simpler formatting available through the Markdown syntax, you can easily
switch the output format for your document among several choices.</p>
<p>The <em>R Markdown Cookbook</em> [ref] includes chapters on how to customize Rmarkdown
output through LaTeX
(<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-output.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-output.html</a>) and HTML
(<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-output.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-output.html</a>). These
customizations can include creating custom formats for the entire document (for
example, you can customize the appearance of a whole HTML document by
customizing the CSS style file for the document). They can also include
smaller-level customizations, like changing the citation style that is used in
conjunction with a BibTeX file by adding to the preamble for LaTeX output.</p>
<p>One area of customization that is particularly useful and simple to implement is
with customized tables. The Markdown syntax can create very simple tables, but
does not allow the creation of more complex tables. There is an R package called
<code>kableExtra</code> [ref] that allows you to create very attractive and complex tables
in RMarkdown documents.</p>
<p>This package leverages more of the power of underlying markup languages, rather
than the simpler Markdown language. If you remember, Markdown is pretty easy to
learn because it has a somewhat limited set of special characters and special
markings that you can use to specify formatting in your output document. This
basic set of functionality is often all you need, but for complex table
formatting, you will need more. There is much more available in the deeper
markup languages that you can use specifically to render pdf documents (software
derived from TeX) and the one that you can use specifically to render HTML (the
HTML markup language). As a result, you will need to create RMarkdown files that
are customized to a single output format (pdf or HTML) to take advantage of this
package.</p>
<p>You can install this package the same as any other R package from CRAN, using
<code>install.packages</code>. You will need to use then need to use <code>library("kableExtra)</code>
within your RMarkdown document before you use functions from the package. The
<code>kableExtra</code> package is extensively documented through two vignettes that come
with package, one if the output will be in pdf
(<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf</a>)
and one if it will be in HTML
(<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html</a>).
There is also information on using <code>kableExtra</code> available through <em>R Markdown
Cookbook</em> [ref]: <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kableextra.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kableextra.html</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.9.4</span> Learning more about Rmarkdown.</h3>
<p>To learn more about RMarkdown, you can explore a number of excellent resources.
The most comprehensive are shared by RStudio, where RMarkdown’s developer
and maintainer, Yihui Xie, works. These resources are all freely available
online, and some are also available to buy as print books, if you prefer that
format.</p>
<p>First, you should check out the online tutorials that are provided by RStudio on
RMarkdown. These are available at RStudio’s RMarkdown page:
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/</a>. The page’s “Getting Started” section
(<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html</a>) provides a nice introduction you
can work through to try out RMarkdown and practice the overview provided in the
last subsection of this module. The “Articles” section
(<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles.html" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles.html</a>) provides a number of other
documents to help you learn RMarkdown. RStudio’s RMarkdown page also includes a
“Gallery” (<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html</a>). This resource allows you
to browse through example documents, so you can get a visual idea of what you
might want to create and then access the example code for a similar document.
This is a great resource for exploring the variety of documents that you can
create using RMarkdown.</p>
<p>To go more deeply into RMarkdown, there are two online books from some of the
same team that are available online. The first is <em>R Markdown: The Definitive
Guide</em> by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund [ref]. This book is
available free online at <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/</a>. It moves from
basics through very advanced functionality that you can implement with
RMarkdown, including several of the topics we highlight later in this
subsection.</p>
<p>The second online book to explore from this team is <em>R Markdown Cookbook</em>, by
Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, and Emily Riederer [ref]. This book is available
free online at <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/</a>. This book is a
helpful resource for dipping in to a specific section when you want to learn how
to achieve a specific task. Just like a regular cookbook has recipes that you
can explore and use one at a time, this book does not require a comprehensive
end-to-end read, but instead provides “recipes” with advice and instructions for
doing specific things. For example, if you want to figure out how to align a
figure that you create in the center of the page, rather than the left, you can
find a “recipe” in this book to do that.</p>

"Most scholarly works have citations and a bibliography or reference section. …
The purpose of the bibliography is to provide details of the works that are
cited in the text. We shall refer to cited works as <em>references</em>. …
The bibliography entries are listed as <citation label> <bibliography 
content>. The <citation label> of a reference is also used when the work is
cited in the text. The <bibliography content> lists the relevant information
about the work. … Even within a single work there may be different styles of
citations. <em>Parenthetical citations</em> are usually formed by putting one or
several citation labels inside square brackets or parentheses. However,
there are also other forms of citations that are derived from information in
the citation label. … The <code>\bibliographystyle</code> command tells LaTeX which
style to use for the bibliography [e.g., labels as numbers, labels as
names and years]. The bibliography style called
<style>
, is defined in the
file
<style>
<p>.bst. … for citations you use the <code>\cite</code> command. The
argument of the <code>\cite</code> command is the logical label of the work you cite."
<span class="citation">(Van Dongen 2012)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since bibliographies are important and since it’s easy to get them wrong,
some of the work related to the creation of the bibliography has been
automated. This is done by BibTeX. The BibTeX tool requires an external human-readable bibliography database. The database may be viewed as a collection
of records. The record defines the title of the work, the author(s) of the work, the year of publication, and so on. The record also defines the logical
label of the work. This is the label you use when you <code>\cite</code> the work.
The advantage of using BibTeX is that you provide the information of the
entries in the bibliography and that BibTeX generates the text for the
bibliography. This guarantees consistency and ease of mind. Furthermore,
the BibTeX database is reusable and you may find BibTeX descriptions of
many scholarly works on the web. … Generating the bibliography with
BibTex is a multi-stage process, which requires an external program called
bibtex. The bibtex program is to BibTeX what the latex program is to LaTeX.”

<p>“This chapter is an introduction to presenting pictures that are stored in
external files. Historically, this was an important mechanism for importing
pictures. … The <code>figure</code> environment is used to present pictures, diagrams,
and graphs. The environment creates a <em>floating</em> environment. <em>Floating</em>
environments don’t allow pagebreaks and they may ‘float’ to a convenient
location in the output document. This mechanism gives LaTeX more freedom to
choose better page breaks for the remaining text. … However, it should be
noted that you can also force the typesetting of a floating environment at the
‘current’ position in the output file. … LaTeX gives some control over the
placement of floating figures, of floating tables, and other floats. For figures
the placement is controlled with an optional argument of the <code>figure</code>
environment. The same mechanism is used for the <code>table</code> environment… The
optional argument, which controls the placement, may contain any combination of
the letters <code>t</code> [top of the page], <code>b</code> [bottom of a page], <code>p</code> pseparate page
with no text], <code>h</code> [approximately at the current position], and <code>H</code> [at the
current position] … The default value for the optional argument is <code>tbp</code>.
LaTeX parses the letters in the optional argument from left to right and puts
the figure at the position corresponding to the first letter for which it thinks
the position is ‘reasonable.’ Good positions are the top of the page, the bottom
of the page, or a page with floats only, because these positions do not disturb
the running text too much.” <span class="citation">(Van Dongen 2012)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have already seen how to present information in <code>tabular</code> environments.
The <code>table</code> environment creates a <em>floating</em> table. As with the <code>figure</code>
environment, this puts the body of the environment in a numbered table,
which may be put in a different place in the document than where it’s
actually defined. The table placement is controlled with an optional argument.
This optional argument works as with the optional argument of the
<code>figure</code> environment.” <span class="citation">(Van Dongen 2012)</span></p>

<p>“A BibTeX database is a plain text (ASCII) file that contains bibliographical
entries internally structured as keyword/value pairs. … Each entry in a
BibTeX database consists of three main parts: a <em>type</em> specifier, followed
by a <em>key</em>, and finally the <em>data</em> for the entry itself. The <em>type</em> describes
the general nature of the entry (e.g., whether it is an article, book, or
some other publication). The <em>key</em> is used in the interface to LaTeX; it
is the string that you have to place in the argument of a <code>\cite</code> command when
referencing that particular entry. The <em>data</em> part consists of a series of
<em>field entries</em> depending on the <em>type</em>), which can have one of two forms…
The comma is the field separator. Spaces surrounding the equals sign or the
comma are ignored. Inside the text part of a field (enclosed in a pair of
double quotes or a pair of braces) you can have any string of characters,
but braces must be matched. The quotes or braces can be omitted for text
consisting entirely of numbers (like the year field…). … BibTeX <em>ignores</em>
the case of the letters for the entry type, key, and field names. You must,
however, be careful with the key. LaTeX honors the case of the keys specifically
as the argument for a <code>\cite</code> command, so the key for a given bibliographic
entry must match the one specified in the LaTeX file.” <span class="citation">(Mittelbach et al. 2004)</span></p>

<p>“The document format ‘R Markdown’ was first introduced in the <code>knitr</code>
package in early 2012. The idea was to embed code chunks (of R or other
languages) in Markdown documents. In fact, <code>knitr</code> supported several
authoring languages from the beginning in addition to Markdown, including
LaTeX, HTML, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, and Textile. Looking back over
the five years, it seems to be fair to say that Markdown has become the
most popular document format, which is what we expected. The simplicity
of Markdown clearly stands out among these document formats.” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“However, the original version of Markdown invented by John Gruber was
often found overly simple and not suitable to write highly technical
documents. For example, there was no syntax for tables, footnotes,
math expressions, or citations. Fortunately, John MacFarlane created a
wonderful package named Pandoc to convert Markdown documents (and many
other types of documents) to a large variety of output formats. More
importantly, the Markdown syntax was significantly enriched.
Now we can write more types of elements with Markdown while still enjoying
its simplicity.” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“In a nutshell, R Markdown stands on the shoulders of <code>knitr</code> and Pandoc.
The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts
R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format
you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on.).” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“R Markdown may not be the right format for you if you find these elements
not enough for your writing: paragraphs, (section) headers, block quotations,
code blocks, (numbered and unnumbered) lists, horizontal rules, tables, inline
formatting (emphasis, strikeout, superscripts, subscripts, verbatim, and
small caps text), LaTeX math expressions, equations, links, images, footnotes,
citations, theorems, proofs, and examples. We believe this list of elements
suffice for most technical and non-technical documents.” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Please do not underestimate the customizability of R Markdown because of the
simplicity of its syntax. In particular, Pandoc templates can be surprisingly
powerful, as long as you understand the underlying technologies such as LaTeX and
CSS, and are willing to invest time in the appearance of your output
documents (reports, books, presentations, and / or websites).” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“R Markdown documents are often portable in the sense that they can be
compiled to multiple types of output formats. Again, this is mainly due to the
simplified syntax of the authoring language, Markdown. The simpler the elements
in your document are, the more likely that the document can be converted to
different formats. Similarly, if you heavily tailor R Markdown to a specific
output format (e.g., LaTeX), you are likely to lose the portability, because not
all features in one format work in another format.” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Last but not least, your computing results will be more likely to be
reproducibly if you use R Markdown (or other <code>knitr</code>-based source documents),
compared to the manual cut-and-paste approach. This is because the results
are dynamically generated from computer source code. If anything goes wrong
or needs to be updated, you can simply fix or update the source code, compile
the document again, and the results will automatically be updated. You can
enjoy reproducibility and convenience at the same time.” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is a fundamental assumption underneath R Markdown that users should
be aware of: we assum it suffices that only a limited number of features are
supported in Markdown. By ‘features,’ we mean the types of elements you can
create with native Markdown. The limitation is a great feature, not a bug.”
<span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a
single R Markdown file to both: save and execute code, and; generate high
quality reports that can be shared with an audience. R Markdown was designed
for easier reproducibility, since both the computer code and narratives
are in the same document, and results are automatically
generated from the source code.” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>

Language), so sometimes it’s also called the YAML metadata or the YAML
frontmatter. Before it bites you hard, we want to warn you in advance
that indentation matters in YAML, so do not forget to indent the sub-fields
of a top field properly. … The body of a document follows the metadata.
The syntax for text (also known as prose or narratives) is Markdown…
There are two types of computer code… a code chunk starts with three
backticks … and ends with three backticks… An inline R code expressions
starts with <code>`r</code> and ends with a backtick.” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>

<p>“The idea [of R Markdown] should be simple enough: interweave narratives
with code in a document, knit the document to dynamically generate results

Programming’ (Knuth, 1984).” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>

<p>“There are multiple ways to insert citations [in Markdown], and we
recommend that you use BibTeX databases, because they work better when

a BibTeX database (a plain-text file with the conventional filename extension
<code>.bib</code>) that contains entries like … you may add a field named
<code>bibliography</code> to the YAML metadata, and set its value to the path of the
BibTeX file. Then in Markdown, you may use <code>@R-base</code> … to reference the
BibTeX entry. Pandoc will automatically generate a list of references in the
end of the document.” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>

text output, tables, or graphics. You have fine control over all these output
via chunk options, which can be provided inside the curly braces. … There are
a large number of chunk options in <code>knitr</code> document at <a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/options" class="uri">https://yihui.name/knitr/options</a>.

<p>“PDF documents are generated thorugh the LaTeX files generated from R
Markdown. A highly surprising fact to LaTeX beginners is that figures float
by default: even if you generate a plot in a code chunk on the first page,
the whole figure environment may float to the next page. This is just how
LaTeX works by default. It has a tendency to float figures to the top or
bottom of pages. Although it can be annoying and distracting, we recommend
that you refrain from playing the ‘Whac-A-Mole’ game in the beginning of your
writing, i.e., desparately trying to position figures ‘correctly’ while
they seem to be always dodging you. You may wish to fine-tune the positions
once the content is complete using the <code>fig.pos</code> chunk option.” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>

<p>“A less well-known fact about R Markdown is that many other languages are also
supported, such as Python, Julia, C++, and SQL. The support comes from the
<code>knitr</code> package, which has provided a large number of <em>language engines</em>.
Language engines are essentially functions registered in the object
<code>knitr::knit_engine</code>. … To use a different language engine, you can change the
language name in the chunk headerf rom <code>r</code> to the engine name… For engines
that rely on external interpreters such as <code>python</code>, <code>perl</code>, and <code>ruby</code>, the
default interpreters are obtained from <code>Sys.which()</code>, i.e., using the
interpreter found via the environment variable <code>PATH</code> of the system. If you want
to use an alternative interpreter, you may specify its path in the chunk option
<code>engine.path</code>. … Most engines will execute each code chunk in a separate new
session (via a <code>system()</code> call in R), which means objects created in memory in a
previous code chunk will not be directly available to latter code chunks. …
Currently, the only expections are <code>r</code>, <code>python</code>, and <code>julia</code>. Only these
engines execute code in the same session throughout the document. To clarify,
all <code>r</code> code chunks are executed in the same R session, all <code>python</code> code chunks
are executed in the same Python session, and so on, by <em>the R session and the
Python session are independent.</em>” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>

<p>“You can also write Shell scripts in R Markdown, if your system can run them
(the executable <code>bash</code> or <code>sh</code> should exist). Usually this is not a problem for
Linux or macOS users. It is not impossible for Windows users to run Shell scripts, but you will have to install additional software (such as Cygwin or the Linux Subsystem).” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>

<p>“R Markdown documents can also generate interactive content. THere are two
types of interactive R Markdown documents: you can use the HTML Widgets
framework, or the Shiny framework (or both). … The HTML Widgets framework is
implemented in the R package <code>htmlwidgets</code>, interfacing JavaScript libraries
that create interactive applications, such as interactive graphics and tables.
… The <code>shiny</code> package builds interactive web apps powered by R. … You may
use Shiny to run any R code that you like in response to user actions. Since web
browsers cannot execute R code, Shiny interactions occur on the server side and
rely on a live R session. By comparison, HTML widgets do not require a live R
session to support them, because the interactivity comes from the client side
(via JavaScript in the web browser).” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>

single R Markdown source document, and it generates a single output file.
However, it is also possible to work with multiple Rmd documents in a
project, and organize them in a meaningful way (e.g., pages can
reference each other). Currently there are two major ways to build
multiple Rmd documents: blogdown for building websites, and bookdown for
authoring books.” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“With blogdown, you can write a blog post or a general page in an Rmd
document, or a plain Markdown document. These source documents will be
built into a static webset, which is essentially a folder containing static
HTML files and associated assets (such as images and CSS files). You
can publish this folder to any web server as a website. Because it is
only a single folder, it can be easy to maintain. … Because the website
is generated from R Markdown, the content is more likely to be reproducible,
and also easier to maintain (no cut-and-paste results). Using Markdown
means your content could be more protable in the sense that you may convert
your pages to PDF or other formats in the future, and you are not tied to the
default HTML format.” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>

<p>“Academic journals often have strict guidelines on the formatting for
submitted articles. As of today, few journals directly support R
Markdown submissions, but many support the LaTeX format. While you can
convert R Markdown to LaTeX, different journals have different
typesetting requirements and LaTeX styles, and it may be slow and
frustrating for all authors who want to use R Markdown to figure out
the technical details about how to properly convert a paper based on
R Markdown to a LaTeX document that meets the journal requirements. The
rticles package is designed to simplify the creation of documents that
conform to submission standards. A suite of custom R Markdown templates
for popular journals is provided… Understanding of LaTeX is recommended,
but not essential, to use this package. R Markdown templates may sometimes
inevitably contain LaTeX code, but usually we can use the simpler Markdown
and knit syntax to produce elements like figures, tables, and
math equations…” <span class="citation">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)</span></p>
