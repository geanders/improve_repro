<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Simplify scripted pre-processing through R’s ‘tidyverse’ tools</h2>
<p>The R programming language now includes a collection of ‘tidyverse’ extension
packages that enable user-friendly yet powerful work with experimental data,
including pre-processing and exploratory visualizations. The principle behind
the ‘tidyverse’ is that a collection of simple, general tools can be joined
together to solve complex problems, as long as a consistent format is used for
the input and output of each tool (the ‘tidy’ data format taught in other
modules). In this module, we will explain why this ‘tidyverse’ system is so
powerful and how it can be leveraged within biomedical research, especially for
reproducibly pre-processing experimental data.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define R’s ‘tidyverse’ system</li>
<li>Explain how the ‘tidyverse’ collection of packages can be both user-friendly
and powerful in solving many complex tasks with data</li>
<li>Describe the difference between base R and R’s ‘tidyverse’.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Limitations of object-oriented programming</h3>
<p>In previous sections, we described how the R programming language allows for
object-oriented programming, and how customized objects are often used in
preprocessing for biological data. This is a helpful approach for preprocessing,
because it can handle complexities in biological data at its early stages of
preprocessing, when R must handle complex input formats from equipment like
flow cytometers or mass spectrometers, and data sizes that are often very large.</p>
<p>However, once you have preprocessed your data, it is often possible to work with it
in a smaller, more consistent object type. This will give you a lot of flexibility
and power. While object-oriented approaches can handle complex data, it can be a
little hard to write and work with code that is built on an object oriented approach.
Working with this type of code requires you to keep track of what object type your
data is in at each stage of a code pipeline, as well as which functions can work with
that type of object.</p>
<p>Further, this type of coding, in practice at least, can be a bit inflexible.
Often, specific functions only work with a single or few types of functions. In
theory, object-oriented programming allows for <em>methods</em> that work in customized
ways with different types of objects to apply customized code to that type of
object for similar, common-sense results. For example, there are often <code>summary</code>
and <code>plot</code> methods for most types of objects, and these apply code that is
customized to that object type and output, respectively, summarized information
about the data in the object and a plot of the data in the object. However, when
you want to do more with the object that summarize it or create its default
plot, you often end up needing to move to more customized functions that work
only with a single or few object types. When you get to this point, you find that
you have to remember which functions work with which object type, and you have to
use different functions at different stages of your code pipeline, as your code
changes from one object class to another.</p>
<p>Further, many of these functions input one object type and output a different
one. This evolution of object types for storing data can be difficult to navigate
and keep track of. Different object types store data in different ways, and so
this evolution of data object types for storage can make it tricky to figure out
how to extract and explore data along the pipeline. It makes it hard to write your
own code to explore and visualize the data along the way, as well, and so users
are often restricted to the visualization and analysis functions pre-made and
shared in packages when working with data in complex object types, especially
until the user becomes very comfortable with coding in R.</p>
<p>Overall, what does this all mean? Object-oriented approaches offer real advantages
early in the process of pre-processing biological data, especially complex and
large data output from complex laboratory equipment. However, once this pre-processing
is completed, there is a big advantage in moving the data into a simple format
and then continuing coding, data analysis, and visualization using tools that
work with this simple format. This is the approach taken by a suite of R packages
called the “tidyverse”, as well as extensions that build off the approach that
this suite of tools embraces. This “tidyverse” approach is described in the
next section.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-tidyverse-approach" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> The “tidyverse” approach</h3>
<p>The term “elegance” often captures styles and approaches that are beautiful and
functional without unneeded extras or complexity. Engineers and scientists
sometimes use this term to capture approaches that achieve a desired result with
minimal complexity and friction. A coding problem, for example, could be solved
by an average coder with a hundred lines of code that get the job done, but a
very good coder might be able to solve the same problem with five lines of code
that are easy to follow. The second approach would be applauded as the “elegant”
solution. In mathematics, similarly, proofs can be complex and unwieldy, or they
can be simple and elegant—this idea was beautifully captured by the Hungarian
mathematician Paul Erdos, who famously described very elegant mathematical proofs
as being from “The Book”—that is, God’s own version of the proof of the
mathematical idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Paul Erdos liked to talk about The Book, in which God maintains the perfect
proofs for mathematical theorems, following the dictum of G. H. Hardy that
there is no permanent place for ugly mathematics. Erdos also said that you
need not believe in God but, as a mathematician, you should believe in
The Book.” [Proofs from the Book, Third Edition, Preface]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “tidyverse” approach in R is elegant. It is powerful, and gives you immense
flexibility once you’ve gotten the hang of it, but it’s also so straightforward
that the basics can be quickly taught to and applied by beginning coders. It
focuses on keeping data in a simple, standard format called “tidy” dataframes.
By keeping data in this format while working with it, common tools can be applied
that work with the data at any stage of a “tidy” coding pipeline. These tools take
a “tidy” dataframe as their input, and they also output a “tidy” dataframe, with
whatever change the function implements applied. Because each of these “tidyverse”
tools input and output data in the same standard format, they can be strung together
in order you want. By contrast, when functions input and output data in different
object types, they can only be joined in a specified order, because you can only
apply certain functions to certain object types.</p>
<p>Since the “tidyverse” tools can be strung together in any order, they can be
used very flexibly to build up to do interesting tasks. The tidyverse tools
generally each do very small and simple things. For example, one function
(<code>select</code>) just limits the data to a subset of its original columns; another
(<code>mutate</code>) adds or changes values in columns of the dataset, while another
(<code>distinct</code>) limits the dataframe to remove any rows that are duplicates. These
small, simple steps can be combined together in different patterns to add up to
complex operations on the data, while keeping each step very simple and clear.
Since the data stays in a standard and simple object type, it is easy to check
in on your data at any stage, as the common visualization tools for this
approach (from the <code>ggplot2</code> package and its extensions) can be always be
applied to data stored in a tidy dataframe.</p>
<p>The centralizing principal of the tidyverse approach is the format in which data
is stored throughout “tidyverse” coding—the tidy dataframe. We’ve described
this data type, including its rules and advantages, in an earlier module of this
book. Briefly, you can think of this format in two parts. First, there’s the R
object type that the data should be stored in—a basic “dataframe” object. The
dataframe object type is a very basic two-dimensional format for storing data in
R. When you print it out, it will remind you of looking at data in a
spreadsheet. The two dimensions—rows and columns—allow you to include data
for one or more observations, with different values that were measured for each.
For example, if you were conducting a study of children’s BMI and blood sugar,
you might have an observation for each child in the study, and values measured
for each child of height, weight, a blood sugar measure, study ID, and date of
the observation.</p>
<p>The two-dimensional structure of a dataframe keeps the values
measured for each observation lined up with each other, and lets you keep them
aligned as you work with the data. You could also store data for each value as
separate objects, in one-dimensional vectors, which you can visualize as strings
of values of the same data type, like the dates that each observation was made,
or the weight of each study subject. However, when the data is in separate
vectors, it is easy to make coding mistakes, and coding is often less efficient.
If you want to remove one observation, for example, because you find it is a
duplicate, you would need to carefully make sure you remove it correctly from
each vector. When data are stored in a dataframe, you can remove the row for
that observation with one command, and you can be sure that you’ve removed the
value you meant to from each of the measured values.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll see that data in a tidyverse approach are stored in a special
type of dataframe called a “tibble”—this isn’t very different from a
dataframe, and in fact is a special type of dataframe. It’s only differences in
practice are that it has a slightly different <code>print</code> method. The <code>print</code> method
is the method that’s run, by default, when you just type the R object’s name
at the console. A tibble prints more nicely than a basic dataframe. By default,
it will only print the first few lines. By contrast, a dataframe will, by default,
print everything—if you have a lot of data, this can create an overwhelming
amount of output when you just want to check out what the data looks like. The
printout of a tibble will also include some interesting annotations to help you
see what’s in the data, including the dimensions of the full dataframe and the
data type of each column in the data.</p>
<p>The R object class—dataframe, and more specifically, tibble—of the standard
format for data for a tidyverse approach is just the first part of the standard
data format for the tidyverse approach. The second part of the standard format is
how you organize your data in this format. To easily work with tidyverse functions,
you’ll want to make sure that your data is stored within that dataframe following
“tidy” data principals. These are fully described in an earlier module in this
book [which module]. If you use this data format to initially collect your
data, as described in an earlier module, you will find it very easy to read the
data into R and work within the tidyverse approach. When working with larger and
more complex data collected from laboratory equipment, you may find you need to
do some preprocessing of the data using an object-oriented approach before you
can move the data into this tidy format, but at that point, you can continue with
analysis and visualization of your data using a tidyverse approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-tidyverse" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> How to “tidyverse”</h3>
<p>Once data are in the “tidy” data format, you can create a pipeline of code that
uses small tools, each of which does one simple thing, to work with the data.
This work can include cleaning the data, adding values that are functions of the
original values for each observation (e.g., adding a column with BMI based on
values for each observation on height and weight), applying statistical models to
test hypotheses, summarizing data to create tables, and visualizing the data.</p>
<p>The tidyverse approach is now widely taught, both in in-person courses at
universities and through a variety of online resources. One key resource for
learning the tidyverse approach for R is the book <em>R for Data Science</em> by Hadley
Wickham (the primary developer of the tidyverse) and Garrett Grolemund. This
book is available as a print edition through O’Reilly Media. It is also freely
available online at <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/" class="uri">https://r4ds.had.co.nz/</a>. This book is geared to beginners in
R, moving through to get readers to an intermediate stage of coding expertise,
which is a level that will allow most scientific researchers to powerfully
work with their experimental data. The book includes exercises for practicing the
concepts, and a separate online book is available with solutions for the
exercises (<a href="https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/" class="uri">https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/</a>).</p>
<p>[More on other resources for learning the tidyverse.]</p>
<p>Since there are so many excellent resources available—many for free—to learn
how to code in R using the tidyverse approach, we consider it beyond the scope
of these modules to go more deeply into these instructions. However, we do think
it is critical that biological researchers learn how to connect this approach to
the type of coding that is often necessary for pre-processing large and complex
data that is output from laboratory equipment. Through many of the modules in this book,
we provide advice on how to make these connections, so that data from different
sources—including different types of laboratory equipment and hand-recorded data
collected by personnel in the lab, like colony forming units measured from plating
samples—can all be connected in a tidyverse pipeline by recording hand-recorded
data following a tidy format and by pre-processing data with the aim of moving
data toward a tidy dataframe that can be integrated with other “tidy” data for
analysis and visualization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There is a now-old trope in the world of programming. It’s called the ‘worse is
better’ debate; it seeks to explain why the Unix operating systems (which include
Mac OS X these days), made up of so many little interchangeable parts, were so much
more successful in the marketplace than LISP systems, which were ideologically pure,
based on a single languagae (again, LISP), which itself was exceptionally simple,
a favorite of ‘serious’ hackers everywhere. It’s too complex to rehash here, but one
of the ideas inherent within ‘worse is better’ is thata systems made up of many
simple pieces that can be roped together, even if those pieces don’t share a consistent
interface, are likely to be more successful than systems that are designed with consistency
in every regard. And it strikes me that this is a fundamental drama of new technologies.
Unix beat out the LISP machines. If you consider mobile handsets, many of which run
descendants of Unit (iOS and Andriod), Unix beat out Windows as well. And HTML5 beat out
all of the various initiatives to create a single unified web. It nods to accessibility:
it doesn’t get in the way of those who want to make something huge and interconnected.
But it doesn’t enforce; it doesn’t seek to change the behavior of page creators in the
same way that such lost standards as XHTML 2.0 (which eremged from the offices of
the World Wide Web Consortium, and then disappeared under the weight of its own
intentions) once did. It’s not a bad place to end up. It means that there is no
single framework, no set of easy rules to lear, no overarching principles that,
once learned, can make the web appear like a golden statue atop a mountain. There
are just components: HTML to get the words on the page, forms to get people to
write in, videos and images to put up pictures, moving or otherwise, and
JavaScript to make everything dance.” <span class="citation">(Ford 2014)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of the fundamental contributions of the Unix system [is] the idea of a <em>pipe</em>.
A pipe is a way to connect the output of one program to the input of another program
without any temporary file; a <em>pipeline</em> is a connection of two or more programs through
pipes. … Any program that reads from a terminal can read from a pipe instead; any program
that writes on the terminal can write to a pipe. … The programs in a pipeline actually
run at the same time, not one after another. This means that the programs in a pipeline
can be interactive; the kernel looks after whatever scheduling and synchronization is needed
to make it all work. As you probably suspect by now, the shell arranges things when you
ask for a pipe; the individual programs are oblivious to the redirection.” <span class="citation">(Kernighan and Pike 1984)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even though the Unix system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques,
no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is an approach
to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can’t be written
down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from
the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Many Unix programs do
quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and
useful tools.” <span class="citation">(Kernighan and Pike 1984)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is ‘Unix’? In the narrowest sense, it is a time-sharing operating system <em>kernel</em>:
a program that controls the resources of a computer and allocates them among its users.
It lets users run their programs; it controls the peripheral devices (discs, terminals,
printers, and the like) connected to the machine; and it provides a file system that
manages the long-term storage of information such as programs, data, and documents.
In a broader sense, ‘Unix’ is often taken to include not only the kernel, but also
essential programs like compiles, editors, command languages, programs for copying and
printing files, and so on. Still more broadly, ‘Unix’ may even include programs
develpoed by you or others to be run on your system, such as tools for document
preparation, routines for statistical analysis, and graphics packages.” <span class="citation">(Kernighan and Pike 1984)</span></p>
