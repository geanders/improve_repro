<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.10</span> Enhance the reproducibility of collaborative research with version control platforms</h2>
<p>Once a researcher has learned to use <em>git</em> on their own computer for
local version control, they can begin using version control platforms (e.g.,
<em>GitLab</em>, <em>GitHub</em>) to collaborate with others under version
control. We will describe how a research team can benefit from using a version
control platform to work collaboratively.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List benefits of using a version control platform to collaborate
on research projects, particularly for reproducibility</li>
<li>Describe the difference between version control (e.g., <em>git</em>) and
a version control platform (e.g., <em>GitLab</em>)</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.10.2</span> Subsection 1</h3>
<p>As the proverb about too many cooks in the kitchen captures, any time you have
multiple people working on a project, it introduces the chance for conflicts.
While higher-level conflicts, like about what you want the final product to look
like or who should do which jobs, can’t be easily managed by a computer program,
now the complications of integrating everyone’s contributions—and letting
people work in their own space and then bring together their individual work
into one final joint project—can be. While these programs for version control
were originally created to help with programmers developing code, they can be
used now to coordinate group work on numerous types of file-based projects,
including scientific manuscripts, books, and websites <span class="citation">(Raymond 2009)</span>.
And although they can work with projects that include binary code, they thrive
in projects with a heavier concentration of text-based files, and so they fit in
nicely in a scientific research / data analysis workflow that is based on data
stored in plain text formats and data analysis scripts written in plain text
files, tools we discuss in other parts of this book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The most primitive (but still very common) method [of version control] is all
hand-hacking. You snapshot the project periodically by manually copying everything
in it to a backup. You include history comments in source files. You make verbal
or email arrangements with other developers to keep their hands off certain files
while you hack them.” <span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The hidden costs of this hand-hacking method are high, especially when (as
frequently happens) it breaks down. The procedures take time and concentration;
they’re prone to error, and tend to get slipped under pressure or when the project
is in trouble—that is exactly when they are needed. … To avoid these problems,
you can use a <em>version-control system</em> (VCS), a suite of programs that
automates away most of the drudgery involved in keeping an annotated history of
your project and avoiding modification conflicts.” <span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In a medium-sized project, it often happens that a (relatively small) number
of people work simultaneously on a single set of files, the ‘program’ or the
‘project’. Often these people have additional tasks, causing their working
speeds to differ greatly. One person may be working a steady ten hours a day on
the project, a second may have barely time to dabble in the project enough to
keep current, while a third participant may be sent off on an urgent temporary
assignment just before finishing a modification. It would be nice if each
participant could be abstracted from the vicissitudes of the lives of the
others.” <span class="citation">(Grune 1986)</span></p>

<p>[Under the distributed model, all team members can have their own version of all
the files, work on them and make records of changes they make to the files, and
then occassionally sync with everyone else to share your changes with them and
bring their changes into your copy of the files.] This functionality is called
<em>concurrency</em>, since it allows team members to concurrently work on the same set
of files <span class="citation">(Raymond 2009)</span>. This idea allowed for the development of other
useful features and styles of working, including <em>branching</em> to try out new
ideas that you’re not sure you’ll ultimately want to go with and <em>forking</em>, a
key tool used in open-source software development, which among other things
facilitates someone who isn’t part of the original team getting a copy of the
files they can work with and suggesting some changes that might be helpful.</p>

<p>“VCSs are a huge boon to productivity and code quality in many ways, even for small

work. They help a lot in recovering from mistakes. Perhaps most importantly, they
free programmers to experiment by guarnateeing that reversion to a known-good
state will always be easy.” <span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>

<p>There is one key feature of modern version control that’s
critical to making this work—merging files that started the same but were edited in
different ways and now need to be put back together, bringing any changes made from the
original version. This step is called <em>merging</em> the files. While this is typically
described using the plural, “files”, at a higher-level, you can thing of this as
just merging the <em>changes</em> that two people have made as they edited a single file, a
file where they both started out with identical copies.</p>
<p>Think of the file broken up into each of its separate lines. There will be some lines
that neither person changed. Those are easy to handle in the “merge”—they stay the
same as in the original copy of the file. Next, there will be some lines that one
person changed, but that the other person didn’t. It turns out that these are pretty
easy to handle, too. If only one person changed the line, then you use their version—it’s
the most up-to-date, since if both people started out with the same version, it means
that the other person didn’t make any changes to that part of the file.
Finally, there may be a few lines that both people changed. These are called <em>merge conflicts</em>.
They’re places in the file where there’s not a clear, easy-to-automate way that
the computer can know which version to put into the integrated, latest version of the
file. Different version control programs handle these merge conflicts in different ways.
For the most common version control program used today, <em>git</em>, these spots in the
file are flagged with a special set of symbols when you try to integrate the two updated
versions of the file. Along with the special symbols to denote a conflict, there will
also be <em>both</em> versions of the conflicting lines of the file. Whoever is integrating the
files must go in and pick the version of those lines to use in the integrated version
of the file, or write in some compromise version of those lines that brings in elements
from both people’s changes, and then delete all the symbols denoting that was a conflict
and save this latest version of the file.</p>
<p>There are a number of other features of version control that make it useful for
collaborating on file-based projects with teams. First, these systems allow you
to explain your changes as you make them—in other words, it allows for
<em>annotation</em> of the developing and editing process <span class="citation">(Raymond 2009)</span>. This
provides the team with a full history of why the files evolved in the way they
did across the team. It also provides a way to communicate across the team
members.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You will likely share your code with multiple lab mates or collaborators,
and they may have suggestions on how to improve it. If you email the code
to multiple people, you will have to manually incorporate all the changes
each of them sends.” <span class="citation">(Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[<em>change tracking</em>]
For example, if one person is the key person working on a certain file,
but has run into a problem with one spot and asks another team member to take a
go, then the second team member isn’t limited to just looking at the file and
then emailing some suggestions. Instead, the second person can make sure he or
she has the latest version of that file, make the changes they think will help,
<em>commit</em> those changes with a message (a <em>commit message</em>) about why they think
this change will fix the problem, and then push that latest version of the file
back to the first person. If there are several places where it would help to
change the file, then these can be fixed through several separate commits, each
with their own message. The first person, who originally asked for help, can
read through the updates in the file (most platforms for using version control
will now highlight where all these changes are in the file) and read the second
person’s message or messages about why each change might help. Even better, days
or months later, when team members are trying to figure out why a certain change
was made in that part of the file, can go back and read these messages to get an
explanation.</p>

example, when it’s time to edit, you can cut whole paragraphs, and if you ever
need to get them back, they’ll be right there in the commit history for your

clear one that will make it easy to find that commit if you ever need those

<p>“Using GitHub or any similar versioning / tracking system is not a replacement
for good project management; it is an extension, an improvement for good
project and file management.” <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In recent years, some complementary tools have been developed that make the process of
collaborating together using version control software easier.
Other tools can helps in collaborating on file-based projects, including <em>bug trackers</em>
or <em>issue trackers</em>, which allow the team to keep a running “to-do” list of what needs
to be done to complete the project, all of which are discussed in the next chapter.</p>
<p>Other helpful tools, particularly for compiled
software projects, include <em>build systems</em>. Some of these features come within
Software Configuration Management (SCM) programs <span class="citation">(Raymond 2009)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“GitHub issues are a great way to keep track of bugs, tasks, feature requests,
and enhancements. While classical issue trackers are primarily intended to be
used as bug trackers, in contrast, GitHub issue trackers follow a different
philosophy: each tracker has its own section in every repository and can be used
to trace bugs, new ideas, and enhancements by using a powerful tagging system.
The main objective of issues in GitHub is promoting collaboration and providing
context using cross-references. Raising an issue does not require lengthy forms
to be completed. It only requires a title and, preferably, at least a short description.
Issues have very clear formatting and provide space for anyone with a GitHub account
to provide feedback. … Additional elements of issues are (i) color-coded labels
that help to categorize and filter issues, (ii) milestones, and (iii) one assignee
responsible for working on the issue.” <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“As another illustration of issues and their generic and wide application, we
and others used GitHub issues to discuss and comment on changes in manuscripts
and address reviewers’ comments.” <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The astonishment was that you might want to make even your tiny hacks to
other people’s code public. Before GitHub, we tended to keep those on our own
computer. Nowadays, it is so each to make a fork, or even edit the code directly
in your browser, that potentially anyone can find even your least polished
bug fixes immediately.” <span class="citation">(Irving 2011)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Resources like GitHub are “essential for collaborative software projects
because they enable the organization and sharing of programming tasks between
different remote contributors.” <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With GitHub, while only
collaborators on a public project can directly change the code, anyone else can
<em>suggest</em> changes through a process of copying a version of the project
(<em>forking</em> it), making the changes they would like to suggest, and the asking
the project’s owners to consider integrating the changes back into the main
version of the project through a <em>pull request</em>. GitHub therefore creates a
platform where people can explore, adapt, and add to other people’s coding
projects, enabling a community of coders <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Much more than a code warehouse, GitHub is effectively a social network for
software development.” <span class="citation">(Perkel 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>GitHub has been described as “a kind of bazaar that offers just about any
piece of code you might want—and so much of it free.” <span class="citation">(Metz 2015)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>GitHub can also be used to collaborate on, host, and publish websites and other
online content <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>. It’s GitHub Pages functionality, for example, is
now being used to host a number of books created in R using the <code>bookdown</code>
package, including the online version of this book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The traditional way to promote scientific software is by publishing an associated
paper in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, though, as pointed out by Buckheir and
Donoho, this is just advertising. Additional steps can boost the visibility of
an organization. For example, GitHub Pages are simple websites freely hosted by
GitHub. Users can create and host blog websites, help pages, manuals, tutorials,
and websites related to specific projects.” <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“VCSs, by the way, are not merely good for program code; the manuscript of this
book was maintained as a collection of files under RCS while it was being written.”
<span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, this is the basic idea of modern version control—for a project that
involves a set of computer files, everyone on the team (even if that’s just one
person) has their own copy of a directory with those files on their own
computer, makes changes at the time and in the spots in the files that they
want, and then regularly re-syncs their local directory with everyone else’s to
share changes and updates.</p>
<p><strong>VC platforms as a form of back-up.</strong></p>
<p>One study surveyed neuroscience researchers at a UK institute. “The backup ‘rule
of three’ states that for a file to be sufficiently backed up it should be kept
in three separate locations using two different types of media with one offsite
backup. A lack of an adequate backup solution could mean permanently lost data,
effort and time. In this research, more than 82% of the respondents seemed to be
unaware of suitable backup procedures to protect their data. Some respondents
kept a single backup of work on external hard disks. Others used the
Universities local networked servers as their means of backup.”
<span class="citation">(AlTarawneh and Thorne 2017)</span></p>
<p>“A good approach is to store at least three copies in at least two
geographically distributed locations (e.g., original location such as a desktop
computer, an external hard drive, and one or more remote sites) and to adopt a
regular schedule for duplicating the data (i.e., backup).” <span class="citation">(Michener 2015)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One reason for GitHub’s success is that it offers more than a simple source
code hosting service. It provides developers and researchers with a dynamic
and collaborative environment, often referred to as a social coding platform,
that supports peer review, commenting, and discussion. A diverse range of efforts,
ranging from individual to large bioinformatics projects, laboratory repositories,
as well as global collaborations, have found GitHub to be a productive place
to share code and ideas and collaborate.” <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some scientists also use the combination of git and GitHub to collaborate
on writing scientific
manuscripts and grant proposals <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>For software development projects, funding agencies may ask for plans on how to maintain
access to products if the main package is “orphaned”.</p>
<p><strong>Email attachments in lieu of common access files.</strong></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For example, one group of researchers investigated a large collection of emails
from Enron <span class="citation">(Hermans and Murphy-Hill 2015)</span>. They found that passing Excel files through
email attachements was a common practice, and that messages within emails
suggested that spreadsheets were stored locally, rather than in a location that
was accessible to all team members <span class="citation">(Hermans and Murphy-Hill 2015)</span>, which meant that team
members might often be working on different versions of the same spreadsheet
file. They note that “the practice of emailing spreadsheets is known to result in
serious problems in terms of accountability and errors, as people do not have
access to the latest version of a spreadsheet, but need to be updated of changes
via email.” <span class="citation">(Hermans and Murphy-Hill 2015)</span></p>
<p>“Team members regularly pass data files back and forth by hand, by email, and by
using shared lab or project servers, websites, and databases.”
<span class="citation">(Edwards et al. 2011)</span></p>
<p><strong>Version control for spreadsheets</strong></p>
<p>“Recent versions of spreadsheets now incorporate a ‘Traack Changes’ functionality
which enables highlighting of changes made by different users along with a comment
and review system. Such tools are a start toward this but more robust version control
systems are required particularly in the context of increasingly online and
collaborative method of working where large teams interact with a single document
concurrently.” <span class="citation">(Birch, Lyford-Smith, and Guo 2018)</span></p>
