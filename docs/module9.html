<p>As a research project progresses, researchers will often end up with many files
(e.g., ‘draft1.doc’, ‘draft2.doc’). This can result in an explosion of files,
and it becomes hard to track which files represent the “current” state of a
project. Version control allows researchers to edit and change research project
files more cleanly, while including messages to explain changes and maintaining
the power to backtrack to previous versions.</p>
<p>In this module, we will explain what version control is and how it can be used
in research projects to improve the transparency and reproducibility of
research, particularly for data recording. We’ll introduce you
to the basic idea of version control, using the Git software program as an
example. In later modules, we’ll explain version control platforms like GitHub,
as well as give some tips on how to use both within your research projects.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define “version”, “version control”, “version control software”,
“repository”, “commit”, and “commit message”</li>
<li>Discuss challenges in coordinating changes in project files when working
in teams</li>
<li>List some downsides of physical laboratory notebooks</li>
<li>Distinguish between “version control” and “version control software”</li>
<li>Identify examples of versioning in a digital context (data, code, files)</li>
<li>Discuss how version control principles can improve collaboration in
scientific projects</li>

</h2>
<p>When research groups—or any other professional teams—collaborate on
publications and research, the process can be a bit haphazard. Teams often use
emails and email attachments to share updates on the project, and they sometimes
use email attachments to pass around the latest version of a document for others
to review and edit.</p>
<p>One fascinating example comes from the business world. After the implosion of
Enron, a trove of emails from within the company were released. This set of
emails has become known as the Enron Corpus and has been used for a variety of
research studies. One group of researchers investigated emails from this corpus
that involved people who were doing work with spreadsheets.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Hermans and Murphy-Hill, &lt;span&gt;“Enron’s Spreadsheets and Related Emails.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>189</sup></a></span>
They found that passing Excel files through email attachments was a common
practice, and that messages within emails suggested that spreadsheets were
stored locally, rather than in a location that was accessible to all team
members.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>190</sup></a></span> This meant that team members might often be
working on different versions of the same spreadsheet file. They note that “the
practice of emailing spreadsheets is known to result in serious problems in
terms of accountability and errors, as people do not have access to the latest
version of a spreadsheet, but need to be updated of changes via email.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>191</sup></a></span> The same process for collaboration is often used in
scientific research: one study found, “Team members regularly pass data files
back and forth by hand, by email, and by using shared lab or project servers,
websites, and databases.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Edwards et al., &lt;span&gt;“Science Friction.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>192</sup></a></span></p>
<p>These practices make it very difficult to keep track of all project files, and
in particular, to track which version of each file is the most current. Further,
this process constrains patterns of collaboration—it requires each team member
to take turns in editing each file, or for one team member to attempt to merge
in changes that were made by separate team members at the same time when all
versions are collected.</p>
<p>This process also makes it difficult to keep track of why changes were made, and
often requires one team member to approve the changes of other team members.
While “Track changes” and “Comment” features in software like Microsoft Word can
help the team communicate with each other, these features often lead to a very
messy document at stages in the editing, where it is hard to pick out the
current versus suggested wording, and once a change is accepted or a comment
deleted, these conversations can be lost forever. Finally, word processing tools
are poorly suited to track changes or add suggestions directly to data or code,
as both data and code are usually saved in formats that aren’t native to word
processing programs, and copying them into a format like Word can introduce
problematic hidden formatting that can cause the data or code to malfunction.</p>

</h2>
<p>More and more scientific researchers are tackling these challenges in their own
projects using something called <em>version control</em>. But how does version
control—traditionally a tool of software engineers—relate to collaborating
to collect and analyze scientific research data? Traditionally, experimental
data collected in a laboratory was recorded in a paper laboratory notebook.
These laboratory notebooks played a role not only as the initial recording of
data, but also keep a legal record of the data recorded in the lab.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Amanda Mascarelli, &lt;span&gt;“Research Tools: Jump Off the Page,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 507, no. 7493 (2014): 523–25.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>193</sup></a></span> They were also a resource for collaborating across a
team and for passing on a research project from one lab member to another.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Declan Butler, &lt;span&gt;“Electronic Notebooks: A New Leaf,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 436, no. 7047 (2005): 20–22.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>194</sup></a></span></p>
<p>However, paper laboratory notebooks have a number of limitations. First, they
can be very inefficient. In a time when almost all data analyses—even simple
calculations—are done on a computer, recording research data on paper rather
than directly entering it into a computer is inefficient. Also, any stage of
copying data from one format to another, especially when done by a human rather
than a machine, introduces the chance to copying errors. Handwritten laboratory
notebooks can be hard to read,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.; Jeffrey M Perkel, &lt;span&gt;“Coding Your Way Out of a Problem”&lt;/span&gt; (Nature Publishing Group, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>195</sup></a></span> and
they may lack adequate flexibility to handle the complex experiments often
conducted. Further, electronic alternatives can also be easier to search,
allowing for deeper and more comprehensive investigations of the data collected
across multiple experiments.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Jim Giles, &lt;span&gt;“The Digital Lab: Lab-Management Software and Electronic Notebooks Are Here–and This Time, It’s More Than Just Talk,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 481, no. 7382 (2012): 430–32; Butler, &lt;span&gt;“Electronic Notebooks”&lt;/span&gt;; Perkel, &lt;span&gt;“Coding Your Way Out of a Problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>196</sup></a></span> As one article notes, physical lab notebooks are “usually
chaotic and always unsearchable.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perkel, &lt;span&gt;“Coding Your Way Out of a Problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>197</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Given a widespread recognition of the limitations of paper laboratory notebooks,
in the past couple of decades, there have been a number of efforts, both formal
and informal, to move from paper laboratory notebooks to electronic
alternatives. In some fields that rely heavily on computational analysis, there
are very few research labs (if any) that use paper laboratory notebooks.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Butler, &lt;span&gt;“Electronic Notebooks.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>198</sup></a></span> In other fields, where researchers have traditionally
used paper lab notebooks, companies have been working for a while to develop
electronic laboratory notebooks specifically tailored to scientific research.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Giles, &lt;span&gt;“The Digital Lab.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>199</sup></a></span> Some early adapters were pharmaceutical industrial
labs, where companies had the budgets to get customized versions and the
authority to require their use. In academic laboratories, electronic lab
notebooks have taken longer to be adapted.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.; Butler, &lt;span&gt;“Electronic Notebooks.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>200</sup></a></span> Indeed, a widely adopted platform for electronic laboratory
notebooks has yet to be taken up by the scientific community,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Roberta Kwok, &lt;span&gt;“Lab Notebooks Go Digital,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 560, no. 7717 (2018): 269–70.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>201</sup></a></span>
despite clear advantages of recording data directly into a computer rather than
first using a paper notebook. As Kwok notes in a 2018 commentary,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since at least the 1990s, articles on technology have predicted the imminent,
widespread adoption of electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) by researchers. It has
yet to happen”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>202</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of using customized electronic laboratory notebook software, some
academics are moving their data recording online, but are using more generalized
electronic alternatives, like Dropbox, Google applications, OneNote, and
Evernote.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perkel, &lt;span&gt;“Coding Your Way Out of a Problem”&lt;/span&gt;; Kwok, &lt;span&gt;“Lab Notebooks Go Digital”&lt;/span&gt;; Giles, &lt;span&gt;“The Digital Lab”&lt;/span&gt;; Kendall Powell, &lt;span&gt;“A Lab App for That,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 484, no. 7395 (2012): 553–55.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>203</sup></a></span>
Some scientists have started using version control software, especially the
combination of Git and GitHub, as a way to improve laboratory data recording,
and in particular to improve transparency and reproducibility standards.
These pieces of software share the same pattern as Google applications or
Dropbox—they are generalized tools that have been honed and optimized for ease
of use through their role outside of scientific research, but can be harnessed
as a powerful tool in a scientific laboratory, as well. They are also free—at
least, for GitHub, at the entry and academic levels—and, even better, one
(Git) is open-source.</p>

</h2>
<p>Most scientific research today involves collaboration across a team of
researchers, rather than an individual scientist working alone. Collaboration
drives interdisciplinary science, but it also creates challenges. One
challenge comes with coordinating versions of research materials. These
materials can include data collection files, but can also include other
documents like study protocols, as well as physical materials like cell lines,
antibodies, and model organisms.</p>
<p>A <em>version</em> is one iteration of a research material that is evolving. For
example, a draft of a research paper is one version of that paper. Research data
that you collect may also go through several versions. For example, if you
identify a typo in data after you record it, you may need to correct the typo
and add a note or signature to explain that update. Further, if you are
collecting data at multiple timepoints, you may have new versions of a data file
as you complete each timepoint.</p>
<p>As materials evolve across versions, it introduces challenges in maintaining a
research process that is smooth, efficient, and error-free. One challenge is to
make sure it is always clear which version is the most current, as well as which
version should be used for specific purposes. For example, if several coauthors
are editing a paper draft, it is important to ensure they are all working on the
most recent version.</p>
<p>Another challenge is to coordinate the changes that different people make when
they work on the material at the same time. Scientific collaboration often does
not operate as an assembly line, where one person finishes their work on a
document or material and then hands it off to the next person. Instead, there
will often be several copies of a version in different peoples’ hands, with all
of them working on it at once. One example is a paper draft—often coauthors
all edit the latest draft at the same time, rather than one-by-one.
This creates the challenge of taking the contributions of each person and
coordinating their changes and additions into one primary copy.</p>
<p>A third challenge is to keep track of the changes that are made at each step, as
the document moves from version to version. This record can help in auditing for
errors or bugs that might be introduced as the document evolves. Ideally, the
record also will include some information about why changes were made at each
step.</p>
<p>These challenges can be addressed through a process called <em>version control</em>.
While the term is most commonly used in reference to software development, the
idea of version control is widely relevant. Any process that creates evolving
versions of a document or material can benefit from the idea of version control,
which aims to record and document changes to the material over time, coordinate
the contributions of different members of a team, and revert back to older
versions if needed. In this module, we’ll focus on version control as it applies
to research materials that are electronic (files and directories), but you may
also find it useful to think about how the principles and elements of version
control can be applied to other research materials, like cell lines and
antibodies.</p>
</div>

<span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> What are the key elements of version control?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-the-key-elements-of-version-control"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The term <em>version</em> in <em>version control</em> refers to one iteration or state of a
document or set of documents, for example the current version of a data file.
The word <em>control</em> captures the idea of allowing for safe changes and updates to
the version, especially when more than one person is working on it. Part of this
“control” will also include recording the changes made from one version to the
next and annotating reasons for those changes.</p>
<p>The general term <em>version control</em> can refer to any method of syncing
contributions from several people to a file or set of files. Version control of
computer files can be done “by hand”, with a person manually logging each change,
and originally was.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Francis Irving, &lt;span&gt;“Astonishments, Ten, in the History of Version Control,”&lt;/span&gt; 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.flourish.org/2011/12/astonishments-ten-in-the-history-of-version-control/"&gt;https://www.flourish.org/2011/12/astonishments-ten-in-the-history-of-version-control/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>204</sup></a></span> However, it’s much more efficient
to use a computer program to handle this tracking and to coordinate
contributions from multiple people. As Eric Raymond notes in <em>The Art of Unix
Programming</em>, “tracking all that detail is just the sort of thing computers are
good at and humans are not.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Raymond, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Unix Programming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>205</sup></a></span> He goes on to describe version
control as “a suite of programs that automates away most of the drudgery
involved in keeping an annotated history of your project and avoiding
modification conflicts.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>206</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Software for this purpose—<em>version control software</em>—was first developed for
software programming projects. Some popular version control software today
comes from these roots. In this section, we’ll introduce the key features of
version control, and to do so we’ll use examples and terminology from a common
version control software program called Git. While these terms are derived
from this particular software program, they represent ideas that are important
in any implementation of version control. Later, we’ll touch on how some of these
ideas are incorporated in other software, like Google Docs.</p>
<p>The software available for version control tracks electronic files. While the
very earliest version control software systems tracked single files, these
systems quickly moved to tracking sets of files, called <em>repositories</em>. A
repository is almost identical to a file directory (which you may also know as a
file folder), and indeed a repository starts from a file directory. The only
difference is the repository is enhanced with some additional overhead.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Ben Klemens, &lt;em&gt;21st Century c: C Tips from the New School&lt;/em&gt; (" O’Reilly Media, Inc.", 2014).&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>207</sup></a></span> This overhead is added to record how the files in the
directory have changed over time. You can compare this to how you might track
document changes if the documents were paper rather than electronic—you could
store the documents in a paper folder and add a piece of paper where you record
a log of each change you make to the documents in the folder. The extra overhead
that changes a regular file directory to a repository is very similar to the log
in this example. A repository, in other words, is a directory that is under
version control.</p>
<p>In a repository of files that is under version control, the version control
software takes snapshots of how the files look during your work on them. Each
snapshot is called a <em>commit</em>, and it provides a record of which lines in each
file changed from one snapshot to another, as well as exactly how they changed.
The idea behind these commits—recording the differences, line-by-line, between
an older and newer version of each file derives from a longstanding Unix command
line tool called <em>diff</em>. This tool, developed early in the history of Unix at
AT&amp;T’s Bell Labs,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Raymond, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Unix Programming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>208</sup></a></span> is a solid and well-tested tool that does
the simple but important job of generating a list of all the differences between
two plain text files. Each commit in a repository includes the same type of
information about the differences introduced in the files at the time of that
commit.</p>
<p>When you are working with a directory under version control, you explain your
changes as you make them—in other words, version control allows for annotation
of the developing and editing process.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Eric Raymond, &lt;span&gt;“Understanding Version-Control Systems (DRAFT),”&lt;/span&gt; 2009, &lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/version-control/version-control.html"&gt;http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/version-control/version-control.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>209</sup></a></span> Each commit
requires you to enter a <em>commit message</em> describing why the changes in that
commit were made. The commit messages can serve as a powerful tool for
explaining changes to other team members or for reminding yourself in the future
about why certain changes were made. A repository under version control, then,
can include not only a complete history of how files in a project directory have
changed over the course of the project, but also why. If this feature is used
thoughtfully, then the commit history of the project provides a well-documented
description of the project’s full evolution. If you’re working on a manuscript,
for example, when it’s time to edit, you can cut whole paragraphs, and if you
ever need to get them back, they’ll be right there in the commit history for
your project, with their own commit message about why they were cut. If you make
the commit message clear, it will make it easy to find that commit if you ever
need those paragraphs again.</p>
<p>Further, each of the commits is given its own ID tag (in the Git software,
this is done through something called a unique SHA-1 hash),<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Klemens, &lt;em&gt;21st Century c&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>210</sup></a></span>
and version control systems have a number of commands that let you “roll back”
to earlier versions. This provides <em>reversability</em> within the project files,
allowing you to go back to the version as it was when a certain commit was made.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Raymond, &lt;span&gt;“Understanding Version-Control Systems (DRAFT).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>211</sup></a></span></p>
<p>It turns out that this functionality—of being able to roll back to earlier
versions—has a wonderful side benefit when it comes to working on a large
project. It means that you don’t need to save earlier versions of each file. You
can maintain one and only one version of each project file in the project’s
directory, with the confidence that you never “lose” old versions of the file.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Perkel, &lt;span&gt;“Git: The Reproducibility Tool Scientists Love to Hate,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Naturejobs Blog&lt;/em&gt;, 2018; John D Blischak, Emily R Davenport, and Greg Wilson, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;PLoS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; 12, no. 1 (2016).&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>212</sup></a></span> This allows you to maintain a clean and
simple version of the project files, with only one copy of each, ensuring it’s
always clear which version of a file is the “current” one (since there’s only
one version).<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Klemens, &lt;em&gt;21st Century c&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>213</sup></a></span> This also provides the reassurance that you can
try new directions in a project, and always roll back to the old version if that
direction doesn’t work well.</p>
<p>In a 2011 commentary in <em>Nature Methods</em>, Perkel tells a story about how this
functionality helped one researcher keep his project directories simpler:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Early in his graduate career, John Blischak found himself creating figures
for his advisor’s grant application. Blischak was using the programming language
R to generate the figures, and as he iterated and optimized his code, he ran
into a familiar problem: Determined not to lose his work, he gave each new
version a different filename—analysis_1, analysis_2, and so on, for
instance—but failed to document how they had evolved. ‘I had no idea what had
changed between them,’ says Blischak… Using Git, Blischak says, he no longer
needed to maintain multiple copies of his files. ‘I just keep overwriting it and
changing it and saving the snapshots. And if the professor comes back and says,
’oh, you sent me an email back in March with this figure’, I can say, ‘okay,
well, I’ll just bo back to the March version of my code and I can recreate
it’.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perkel, &lt;span&gt;“Git.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>214</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A key strength, then, of using version control is its ability to track every
change made to files in the project, why the change was made, and who made it.
Version control creates a full history of the evolution of each file in the
project. When a change is committed, the history records the exact change made,
including the previous version of the file. No change is ever fully lost,
therefore, unless a great deal of extra work is taken to erase something from
the project’s commit history.</p>
<p>It’s also helpful to understand how version control programs handle
collaboration. In earlier types of version control programs, under what is
called a <em>centralized</em> framework, there was one central repository for the file
or set of files the team was working on.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Raymond, &lt;span&gt;“Understanding Version-Control Systems (DRAFT)”&lt;/span&gt;; Sinclair Target, &lt;span&gt;“Version Control Before Git with CVS,”&lt;/span&gt; 2018, &lt;a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/07/07/cvs.html"&gt;https://twobithistory.org/2018/07/07/cvs.html&lt;/a&gt;; Irving, &lt;span&gt;“Astonishments, Ten, in the History of Version Control.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>215</sup></a></span> A team member who wanted to make
a change would “check out” the file he or she wanted to work on, make changes,
and then check it back in as the newest main version.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Raymond, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Unix Programming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>216</sup></a></span> While
one team member had this file checked out, other members would be locked out of
making any changes to that file—they could look at it, but couldn’t make any
edits.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Raymond, &lt;span&gt;“Understanding Version-Control Systems (DRAFT)”&lt;/span&gt;; Target, &lt;span&gt;“Version Control Before Git with CVS.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>217</sup></a></span> This meant that there was no
chance of two people trying to change the same part of a file at the same time.
In spirit, this early system is pretty similar to the idea of sending a file
around the team by email, with the understanding that only one person works on
it at a time. A slightly more modern analogy is the idea of having a single
version of a file in Dropbox or Google Docs, and avoiding working on the file
when you see that another team member is working on it.</p>
<p>This assembly-line approach is pretty clunky, though. In particular, it usually
increases the amount of time that it takes the team to finish the project,
because only one person can work on a file at a time. Later types of version
control programs moved toward a different style, allowing for <em>distributed</em>
rather than centralized collaborative work on a file or a set of files.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Raymond, &lt;span&gt;“Understanding Version-Control Systems (DRAFT)”&lt;/span&gt;; Irving, &lt;span&gt;“Astonishments, Ten, in the History of Version Control.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>218</sup></a></span> Under the distributed model,
all team members can have their own version of all the files, work on them and
make records of changes they make to the files, and then occassionally sync with
everyone else to share your changes with them and bring their changes into your
copy of the files. This functionality is called <em>concurrency</em>, since it allows
team members to concurrently work on the same set of files.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Raymond, &lt;span&gt;“Understanding Version-Control Systems (DRAFT).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>219</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This idea allowed for the development of other useful features and styles of
working, including <em>branching</em> and <em>forking</em>. Branching allows you to try out
new ideas that you’re not sure you’ll ultimately want to go with. Forking is a
key tool used in open-source software development, and, among other things,
facilitates someone who isn’t part of the original team getting a copy of the
files they can work with and suggesting some changes that might be helpful. So,
this is the basic idea of modern version control—for a project that involves a
set of computer files, everyone on the team has their own copy of the directory
on their own computer, makes changes at the time and in the spots in the files
that they want, and then regularly re-syncs their local directory with everyone
else’s to share changes and updates.</p>
<p>This distributed model also means there is a copy of the full repository on
every team member’s computer, which has the side benefit of providing additional
backup of the project files. Remote repositories—which may be on a server in a
different location—can be added with another copy of the project, which can
similarly be synced regularly to update with any changes made to project files.</p>

</h2>
<p>While there are a number of software systems for version control, one of the
most common currently used for scientific projects is Git. This program was
created by Linus Torvalds, who also created the Linux operating system, in 2005
as a way to facilitate the team working on Linux development. This program for
version control thrives in large collaborative projects, for example open-source
software development projects that include numerous contributors, both regular
and occasional.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Zack Brown, &lt;span&gt;“A Git Origin Story,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/em&gt;, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>220</sup></a></span> As Target notes in a 2018 article about
version control:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“While people sometimes grouse about its steep learning curve or unintuitive
interface, Git has become everyone’s go-to for version control.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Target, &lt;span&gt;“Version Control Before Git with CVS.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>221</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In recent years, some complementary tools have been developed that make the
process of collaborating together using version control software easier. Other
tools, such as bug trackers or issue trackers, facilitate corroborative
file-based projects to allow the team to keep a running “to-do” list of what
needs to be done to complete the project. These tools—which are discussed in
modules <a href="module10.html#module10">10</a> and <a href="module11.html#module11">11</a>—can be used to improve collaboration on scientific
projects done by teams. GitHub is one a very popular version control platform
with these additional tools. It was created in 2008 as a web-based platform to
facilitate collaborating on projects running under Git version control. It can
provide an easier entry to using Git for version control than trying to learn to
use Git from the command line.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Yasset Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;PLoS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; 12, no. 7 (2016).&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>222</sup></a></span> It also interfaces well with RStudio,
making it easy to integrate a collaborative workflow through GitHub from the
same RStudio window on your computer where you are otherwise doing your analysis.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>223</sup></a></span></p>
<p>While Git version control software is one of the best established ways
of implementing version control, there are growing efforts to enable some level
of version control through other platforms. For example, Google Docs enables a
level of version control through its Version History feature. This feature
allows you name different versions of a document as they are is saved in Google
Docs. It also allows you to restore a document to earlier versions, as well as
see which changes have been made to a document and who made each change.</p>
<p>While some generalized tools like Google tools and Dropbox might be simpler to
initially learn, more powerful version control tools like Git offer some key
advantages for recording scientific data and are worth the effort to adopt. A
key advantage is their ability to track the full history of files as they
evolve, including not only the history of changes to each file, but also a
record of why each change was made.</p>
<p>Git excels in tracking changes made to plain text files. For these files,
whether they record code, data, or text, Git can show line-by-line differences
between two versions of the file. This makes it very easy to go through the
history of “commits” to a plain text file in a Git-tracked repository and see
what change was made at each time point, and then read through the commit
messages associated with those commits to see why a change was made. For
example, if a value was entered in the wrong row of a plain text file or
spreadsheet, and the researcher then made a commit to correct that data entry
mistake, the researcher could explain the problem and its resolution in the
commit message for that change.</p>
<p>There are, of course, some limitations to using version control tools when
recording experimental data. First, while ideally laboratory data is recorded in
a plain text format, some data may be recorded in a binary file format. Some
version control tools, including Git, can be used to track changes in binary
files. However, Git does not take to these types of files naturally. In
particular, Git typically will not be able to show a useful comparison of
the differences between two versions of a binary file.</p>
<p>More problems can arise if the binary file is
very large,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.; Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>224</sup></a></span> as some experimental research
data files are (e.g., if they are high-throughput output of laboratory equipment
like a mass spectrometer). However, there are emerging tools and strategies for
improving the ability to include and track large binary files when using Git and
GitHub.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>225</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Finally, as with other tools and techniques described in this book, there is an
investment required to learn how to use Git,<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>226</sup></a></span> as well
as some extra overhead when using version control tools in a project.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Raymond, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Unix Programming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>227</sup></a></span> However, Git can bring dramatic gains to
efficiency, transparency, and organization of research projects, even if you
only use a small subset of its basic functionality.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>228</sup></a></span> In module
<a href="module11.html#module11">11</a>, we provide guidance on getting started with using Git and GitHub to track
a scientific research project.</p>
<p>Third, the combination of Git and GitHub can help as a way to backup study data.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub”&lt;/span&gt;; Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub”&lt;/span&gt;; Perkel, &lt;span&gt;“Git.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>229</sup></a></span> Together, Git and GitHub
provide a structure where the project directory (repository) is copied on
multiple computers, both the users’ laptop or desktop computers and on a remote
server hosted by GitHub or a similar organization. This set-up makes it easy to
bring all the project files onto a new computer—all you have to do is clone
the project repository. It also ensures that there are copies of the full
project directory, including all its files, in multiple places.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>230</sup></a></span> Further, not only is the data backed up across multiple
computers, but so is the full history of all changes made to that data and the
recorded messages explaining those changes, through the repositories commit
messages.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Perez-Riverol et al., &lt;span&gt;“Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>231</sup></a></span></p>
