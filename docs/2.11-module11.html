<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.11</span> Using git and GitLab to implement version control</h2>
<p>For many years, use of version control required use of the command line,
limiting its accessibility to researchers with limited programming experience.
However, graphical interfaces have removed this barrier, and RStudio has
particularly user-friendly tools for implementing version control. In this
module, we will show how to use <em>git</em> through RStudio’s user-friendly
interface and how to connect from a local computer to <em>GitLab</em> through
RStudio.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how to set up and use <em>git</em> through RStudio’s interface</li>
<li>Understand how to connect with <em>GitLab</em> through RStudio to collaborate on<br />
research projects while maintaining version control</li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-use-version-control" class="section level3" number="2.11.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.11.1</span> How to use version control</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we will give you an overview of how to use git and GitHub
for your laboratory research projects. If you prefer an open-source version
control platform, GitLab has similar functionality and can be installed on
a server you own.</p>
<p>We’ll address two separate groups, in separate sections. First, we’ll provide an
overview of how you can leverage and use these tools as the director or manager
of a project, without knowing how to code in a language like R. GitHub provides
a number of useful tools that can be used by anyone, providing a common space
for managing the data recording, analysis and reporting for a scientific
research project. In this case, there would need to be at least one member of
your team who is comfortable with a programming language, but all team members
can participate in many features of the GitHub repository regardless of
programming skill.</p>
<p>Second, we’ll briefly provide some information for scientists who <em>are</em>
programmers or learning to program in a language like R or Python. This
information will provide an overview of setting up git and GitHub with R, as
well as provide directions to more extensive resources. We will not be
exhaustive in this section, as there are a number of excellent resources that
already go into depth on these topics. Instead, we provide an overview of
getting starting, and what tools you might want to try within projects, and then
provide advice on more references to follow up with to learn more and fully
develop these skills.</p>
<p>As an example, we’ll show different elements from a real GitHub repository, used
for scientific projects and papers. The repository is available at
<a href="https://github.com/aef1004/cyto-feature_engineering" class="uri">https://github.com/aef1004/cyto-feature_engineering</a>. It provides example data
and code to accompany a published article on a pipeline for flow cytometry
analysis <span class="citation">(Fox et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="leveraging-git-and-github-as-a-project-director" class="section level3" number="2.11.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.11.2</span> Leveraging git and GitHub as a project director</h3>
<p>Because <code>git</code> has a history in software development, and because most
introductions to it quickly present arcane-looking code commands, you may have
hesitations about whether it would be useful in your scientific research group
if you, and many in your research group, do not have experience programming.
This is not at all the case, and in fact, the combination of git and GitHub can
become a secret weapon for your research group if you are willing to encourage
those in your group who do know some programming (or are willing to learn a bit)
and to take them time to try out this environment for project managemment.
Once a project has been set up in GitHub, there are a number of features
that can be used by all team members, whether they code or not.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous two chapters, repositories that are tracked with
git and shared through GitHub provide a number of tools that are useful in
managing a project, both in terms of keeping track of what’s been done in the
project and also for planning what needs to be done next, breaking those goals
into discrete tasks, assigning those tasks to team members, and maintaining a
discussion as you tackle those tasks.</p>
<p>While <code>git</code> itself traditionally has been used with a command-line interface
(think of the black and green computer screens shown when movies portray
hackers), GitHub has wrapped <code>git</code>’s functionality with an attractive and easy
to understand graphical user interface. This is how you will interact with a
project repository if you are online and logged into GitHub, rather than
exploring it on your own computer (although there are also graphical user
interfaces you can use to more easily explore git repositories locally, on your
computer).</p>
<p>Key project management tools for GitHub that you can leverage, all covered in
subsections below, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commits and commit history</li>
<li>Issues</li>
<li>Repository access and ownership</li>
</ul>
<p>Successfully using GitHub to help track and manage a research project does not
require using all of these tools, and in fact you can go a long way by just starting
with a subset. The first four covered (Commits, Issues, Commit history, and Repository access
and ownership) would be a great set to try out in a first project. In this
section, we’ll highlight these features. At the end of this module, there is a
video demonstration that walks you through the elements we’ve highlighted.</p>
<p>GitHub is free to join (while there are paid plans, the free plan is adequate
for getting started, and academic researchers can request free use of some of
the more extensive versions if needed). To create an account, visit
<a href="https://github.com/" class="uri">https://github.com/</a>. Even if you are not coding, you will need to be logged in
to your GitHub account to contribute to a repository. For some actions, you need
to be a collaborator on a project to take the action; in the later sections of
this module, we describe how people can be added as collaborators in a GitLab
repository.</p>
<p><strong>Commits</strong></p>
<p>Each time a team member makes a change to files in a GitHub repository, the change is
recorded as a <strong>commit</strong>, and the team member must include a short <strong>commit message</strong>
describing the change. Each file in the project will have its own page on GitHub
(Figure <a href="2.11-module11.html#fig:githubcommits1">2.43</a>), and you can see the history of changes to that
files by clicking the “History” link on that page.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>You can make changes to a file locally, on the repository copy on your own computer.
For team members who are working a lot on coding, this will likely be the primary
method they use to make commits, as this allows you to test the code locally before
you commit it.</p>
<p>However, it is also possible to make a commit directly on GitHub, and this may
be a useful option for team members who are not coding and would like to make
small changes to the writing files. On the file’s page on GitHub, there is an
“Edit” icon (Figure <a href="2.11-module11.html#fig:githubcommits1">2.43</a>). By clicking on this, you will
get to a page where you can directly edit the file (Figure
<a href="2.11-module11.html#fig:githubcommits2">2.44</a>). Once you have made your edits, you will need to
commit them, along with a short description of the commit, the “commit message”.
If you would like to include a longer explanation of your changes, there is
space for that, as well, when you make the commit (Figure
<a href="2.11-module11.html#fig:githubcommits2">2.44</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>You can see the full history of changes that have been made to each file in the
project (Figure <a href="2.11-module11.html#fig:githubcommithistory">2.45</a>). Each change is tracked through
a commit, which includes markers of who made the change and a message describing
the change. This allows you to quickly pinpoint changes in a file in your
research project. It also helps you see how team members have contributed as the
file evolves.</p>

<p>If you click on one of the commits listed on a file’s History page (Figure
<a href="2.11-module11.html#fig:githubcommithistory">2.45</a> points to one example of where you would click),
it will take you to a page providing information on the changes made with that
commit (Figure <a href="2.11-module11.html#fig:githubcommithistory2">2.46</a>). This page provides a
line-by-line view of each change that was made to project files with that
commit. This page includes the commit message for that commit. If the person
committing the change included a longer description or commentary on the commit,
this information will also be included. Near the commit message are
listings of which team member made the commit and when it was made. Within the
body of the page, you can see the changes made with the commit. Added lines will
be highlighted in green while deleted lines are highlighted in red. If only part
of a line was changed, it will be shown twice, once in red as its version before
the commit, and once in green showing its version following the commit.
You can visually compare the two versions of the line to see how it was
changed with the commit.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<p>GitHub, as well as other version control platforms, includes functionality that
will help your team collaborate on a project. A key tool is the “Issues”
tracker. Each repository includes this type of tracker, and it can be easily
used by all team members, whether they are comfortable coding or not. Figure
<a href="2.11-module11.html#fig:githubissues1">2.47</a> gives an example of <a href="https://github.com/aef1004/cyto-feature_engineering/issues">the Issues tracker
page</a> for the
repository we are using as an example.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The main Issues tracker page provides clickable links to all open issues for
the repository. You can open a new issue using the “New Issue” on this main
page or on the specific page of any of the repository’s issues (see Figure
<a href="2.11-module11.html#fig:githubissues2">2.48</a> for an example of this button).</p>

Once the Issue is resolved, you can 'Close' the Issue, which moves it off the list of active issues, but allows you to still re-read the conversation and, if necessary, re-open the issue later. You can also open a new issue from this page, using the button highlighted at the top right." width="\textwidth"  />
<p class="caption marginnote shownote">

You can also open a new issue from this page, using the button highlighted at the top right.
</p>
</div>
<p>On the page for a specific issue (e.g., Figure <a href="2.11-module11.html#fig:githubissues2">2.48</a>), you
can have a conversation with your team to determine how to resolve the issue.
This conversation can include web links, figures, and “To-do” check boxes, to
help you discuss and plan how to resolve the issue. Each issue is numbered,
which allows you to track each individually as you work on the project.</p>
<p>Once you have resolved an issue, you can “Close” it. This moves the issue
from the active list into a “Closed” list. Each closed issue still has its
own page, where you can read through the conversation describing how it
was resolved. If you need to, you can re-open a closed issue later, if you
determine that it was not fully resolved.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The Issues tracker page includes some more advanced functionality, as well
(Figure <a href="2.11-module11.html#fig:githubissues3">2.49</a>). For example, you can “assign” an issue to one
of more team members, indicating that they are responsible for resolving that
issue. You can also tag each issue with one of more labels, allowing you to
group issues into common categories. For example, you could tag all issues that
cover questions about pre-processing the data using a “pre-processing” label,
and all that are related to creating figures for the final manuscript with a
“figures” label.</p>
<p><strong>Repository access and ownership</strong></p>
<p>Repositories include functionality for inviting team members, assigning
roles, and otherwise managing access to the repository. First, a repository
can be either public or private. For a public repository, anyone will be
able to see the full contents of the repository through GitHub. You can
also set a repository to be private. In this case, the repository can only
be seen by those who have been invited to collaborate on the repository, and
only when they are logged in to their GitHub accounts. The private / public
status of a repository can be changed at any time, so if you want you can
maintain a repository for a project as private until you publish the results,
and then switch it to be public, to allow others to explore the code and data
that are linked to your published results.</p>
<p>You can invite team members to collaborate on a repository, as long as they
have GitHub accounts (these are free to sign up for). While public repositories
can be seen by anyone, the only people who can add to or change the contents
of the repository are people who have been invited to collaborate on the
repository. The person who creates the repository can invite other collaborators
through the “Settings” tab of the repository, which will have a “Manage access”
function for the repositories maintainer (only the owner of the repository
will have access to this tab for the repo). On this page, you can invite other
collaborators by searching using their GitHub “handle” (the short name they
chose to be identified by in GitHub). You can also change access rights, for
example, allowing some team members to be able to make major changes to the
repository—like deleting it—while others can make only smaller modifications.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.11.3</span> Leveraging git and GitHub as a scientist who programs</h3>
<p>To be able to leverage GitHub to manage projects and share data, you will need
to have at least one person in the research group who can set up the initial
repository. GitHub repositories can be created very easily starting from an
RStudio Project, a format for organizing project files that was described in
module 3.7.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll give some advice on how you can use an RStudio Project to
create and update a GitHub repository, and how this can allow separate team
members to maintain identical copies of the RStudio Project on their own
computers, while continually evolving files in the project as data
pre-processing, data analysis, and manuscript preparation are done for the
project. We will keep this advice limited, as there are excellent existing
resources that provide more thorough instructions in this area, but we will
introduce the methods and then point to more thorough resources for more detail.</p>

<li>Interfacing with RStudio</li>
<li>Initiating a repository and first commit</li>
<li>Subsequent commits and commit messages</li>
<li>Fixing merge conflicts when team members make concurrent changes</li>

<blockquote>
<p>“Get a new repository in the directory you are working in via: <code>git init</code>. Ok, you
now have a revision control system in place. You might not see it, because Git stores
all its files in a directory names <code>.git</code>, where the dot means that all the usual
utilities like <code>ls</code> will take it to be hidden. You can look for it via, e.g.,
<code>ls -a</code> or via a show hidden files option in your favorite file manager. …
Given that all the data about a repository is in the <code>.git\ subdirectory of your project directory, the analog to freeing a repository is simple:</code>rm -rf .git`.”
<span class="citation">(Klemens 2014)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Calling <code>git commit -a</code> writes a new commit object to the repostiory based on
all the changes the index was able to track, and clears the index. Having saved your
work, you can now continue to add more. Further—and this is the real, major
benefit of revision control so far—you can delete whatever you want, confident
that it can be recovered if you need it back. Don’t clutter up the code with large
blocks of commented-out obsolete routines—delete!” <span class="citation">(Klemens 2014)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Having generated a commit object, your interactions with it will mostly consist of
looking at its contents… The key metadata is the name of the object, which is
assigned via an unpleasant but sensible naming convention: the SHA1 has, a
40-digit hexadecimal number that can be assigned to an object, in a manner that
lets us assume that no two objects will have the same hash, and that the same object
will have the same name in every copy of the repository. When you commit your files,
you’ll see the first few digits of the hash on the screen… Fortunately, you
need only as much of the hash as will uniquely identify your commit.”

<p>“Lists aren’t external to the creative process, they are intrinsic to it. They are
a natural part of any project of scale, whether we like it or not.” <span class="citation">(Savage 2020)</span></p>

<p>“The maker in me knows that this is where lists really shine, that it is their capacity
for simplifying the complex that sets them apart from all other planning tools.
Not just at the beginning of a project, either, but at every step along the
creative process, because no matter how exacting the list you make at the outset,
there will always be things that you missed or, more frequently, that change. It’s
like trying to measure a coastline: it’s fractal.” <span class="citation">(Savage 2020)</span></p>

<p>“The value of a list is that it frees you up to think more creatively, by
defining a project’s scope and scale for you on the page, so your brain doesn’t
have to hold on to so much information. The beauty of the checkbox is that it
does the same thing with regard to progress, allowing you to monitor the status
of your project, without having to mentally keep track of everything.” <span class="citation">(Savage 2020)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The best part of making a list is, you guessed it, crossing things off. But when you
physically cross them out, like with a pen, you can make them harder to read, which
destroys their informational value beyond that single project and, to me at least, makes
the whole thing feel incomplete. The checkbox allowed me to cross something off my list,
to see clearly <em>that</em> I’d crossed it off, and at the same time retain all its
information while not also adding to the cognitive load of interpreting the list.”

<p>“<strong>Use version control.</strong> An example is git. This takes time to learn, but the
time is well invested. In the long run, it will be infinitely better than all your
self-grown attempts at managing evolving code with version numbers, switches,
and the like. Moreover, this is the sanest option for collaborative work on code,
and it provides an extra backup of your codebase, especially if the server is
distinct from your personal computer.” <span class="citation">(Holmes and Huber 2018)</span></p>
