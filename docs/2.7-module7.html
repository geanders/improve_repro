<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Creating project directory templates</h2>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<p>The last module described the advantages of organizing all the files for a
research project within a single directory, and the added advantages of using a
consistent directory structure for all of the experiments or projects in your
research group. In this module, we’ll walk through the steps required to design
and create a template for your project directories. Creating and using a common
template for your directory structure for projects will help create consistency
across projects in the directory structure, which can facilitate the use and
re-use of automated tools like code scripts across different experiments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to designed a structured project directory template for
research projects</li>
<li>Understand how project directories can be turned into RStudio “Projects”</li>
</ul>
<div id="goals-in-designing-a-project-template" class="section level3" number="2.7.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.1</span> Goals in designing a project template</h3>
<p>Designing a project template will include two parts—first, designing a
<em>conceptual</em> template for your file organization and, second, creating a
<em>physical</em> implementation of that concept. The conceptual template will
develop a structure and rules for how you’ll organize and name files within a
project directory. The physical template will use these ideas to develop a file
directory that follows that organization, which you can then copy, paste, and
adapt each time you start a new project.</p>
<p>In other words, before you open your computer to make a “physical” template, you
should design it. This involves deciding what types of data will go into a
project directory, how those files will be organized within the directory and
the naming conventions for files. In other words, you should create a blueprint
for your template before you create a physical template.</p>
<p>The hardest part of this is the conceptual part—deciding on the structure and
rules you will consistently use. This is a process of designing, and so you can
make this process a bit easier by following principles that facilitate design.
For example, as you design, it’s useful to start by defining the problem
<span class="citation">(Osann, Mayer, and Wiele 2020)</span>. What are you aiming to achieve with your file organization
system?</p>
<p>Based on our own experiences and the advice of others <span class="citation">(Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen 2018; Bertin and Baumer 2021)</span>, key goals to consider for a research project
directory template are that the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeps all files for a research project within a single directory, using
subdirectories to organize files into a hierarchical structure</li>
<li>Keeps data collection and analysis separate (see module 2.1)</li>
<li>Avoids or removes unnecessary files</li>
<li>Uses meaningful names for files and subdirectories, allowing easy navigation
and discoverability (module 2.6) by a new user</li>
<li>Facilitates creation of reports and analysis that incorporate data from
different assays for an experiment</li>
<li>Makes it easy to share all project files across the team, as well as
publicly, once a paper is published</li>
<li>Makes it easy to implement version control for a project (modules 2.9–2.11)</li>
<li>Incorporates enough flexibility to be used with minimal changes across many
research projects</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="steps-in-designing-the-conceptual-blueprint-for-a-project-directory-template" class="section level3" number="2.7.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2</span> Steps in designing the conceptual blueprint for a project directory template</h3>
<p>As you design a conceptual framework for a project directory template, you
can break the process into a few key steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Observe your current research project practices</li>
<li>Determine which subdirectories you’ll include and how you’ll name them</li>
<li>Decide on file name conventions</li>
</ol>
<p>In this section, we’ll go into detail about each of these tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Observe your current research project practices</strong></p>
<p>As you work on this blueprint, you will want to prioritize how it will fit the
needs of the user—your research group. One way you can do this is to follow a
key early step in the design process: observe <span class="citation">(Osann, Mayer, and Wiele 2020)</span>. One of the
best ways to get an idea of what your research group needs within a project
directory is to take a survey of past research projects from your group. Make a
list of what types of data were collected and what types of pre-processing and
analysis were done using those data. For each type of data, it’s helpful to make
a note its typical file type and typical size. How are data for a specific assay
divided across files? Are the data for all animals and all timepoints included
in a single spreadsheet file? If so, are they saved in the same sheet, or
divided across sheets? Conversely, are different files used for the data from
different animals or different time points?</p>
<p>Doing this kind of survey will help you create a standard structure of
subdirectories that you can use consistently across the directories for all the
projects in your research program. Of course, some projects may not include
certain files, and some might have a new or unusual type of file. You can
customize the directory structure to some degree for these types of cases, but
it is still a big advantage to include as many common elements as possible
across all your projects. The best way to determine what these common elements
might be in future projects is to look at your past projects.</p>
<p>It can also be helpful to have an example of each file type, to help capture
the typical size, structure, and contents of each type of file. For
data that you will record yourself in the lab, these can be the templates that you
developed to collect the data in a tidy format (modules 2.3 through 2.5).
For data from equipment, these can be one or more example files from the
equipment that you have collected for a past project. Having these example files
will help you to develop a template project report that can input the type of
data that you typically collect for this type of project.</p>
<p>This is also a good stage to diagnose if there are data collection files that
are not successful in separating data collection from data pre-processing and
analysis (module 2.1). As you progress, you may also want to add templates that
serve as a starting point for data collection files within this project. This
idea of creating data collection templates is described in detail in modules 2.4
and 2.5.</p>
<p><strong>Determine which subdirectories you’ll include and how you’ll name them</strong></p>
<p>Once you have examined past projects to determine the types of files that you’ll
normally include in a project, you can decide how to organize them into
subdirectories. This subdirectory structure will create the core framework of
your project directory template.</p>
<p>In general, as you design the structure of subdirectories, keep in mind that a
key aim is to create a structure that is general enough that you can use it
consistently for many projects, but also clear enough that you can quickly find
things within the directory. As one paper notes, you want a directory setup that
is “flexible and configurable” <span class="citation">(Blischak, Carbonetto, and Stephens 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>A number of researchers have put a lot of thought into how to organize project
directories for scientific research <span class="citation">(Vuorre and Crump 2021; Johnston 2022; Blischak, Carbonetto, and Stephens 2019; Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen 2018; Noble 2009)</span>. A common theme
across these papers is to include subdirectories to store files in four main
areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>data</li>
<li>code</li>
<li>reports</li>
<li>meta-documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll go through each of these to discuss what might be included in each, as
well as how it might make sense to name subdirectories in each of the areas.</p>
<p><em>Data subdirectories</em></p>
<p>Data should be saved in an area that is separate from any code for analysis. See
module 2.1 for a deeper discussion on the benefits of separating data from
analysis to improve reproducibility. The raw data should also be treated as
“read-only”—in other words, the raw data should never be edited or changed. To
work with the data, including any necessary quality control, pre-processing, or
analysis, these raw data should be read into a separate program for analysis.
That way, you can work with the data (and even create and save intermediary,
“processed” versions of the data), while maintaining the original raw files
without alteration.</p>
<p>There are different recommendations on how to name and organize subdirectories
for data. Several papers recommend having separate subdirectories for the raw
data versus intermediate processed data. Some researchers have suggested naming
the subdirectory for raw data as “data-raw” and the one for intermediate data as
“data” <span class="citation">(Vuorre and Crump 2021; Johnston 2022)</span>. Others have suggested naming the raw
data subdirectory as “data” and the one for intermediate data “outputs”
<span class="citation">(Blischak, Carbonetto, and Stephens 2019)</span>. Either or these choices—or a reasonable
alternative—is fine, as long as you use your naming scheme consistently every
time you set up a project directory. In some cases, you may also decide to use
the raw data directory keep the code scripts that you used to create
intermediate processed data from those raw data <span class="citation">(Johnston 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>One thing that can be challenging is working with raw data files that are
extremely large, as in this case you may not have room on your personal computer
to store the full set of raw data. One article suggested a solution: store a
smaller example dataset in your project directory that can be used to test or
demonstrate the analysis code, while storing the full set of raw data files on a
computer with adequate storage capacity <span class="citation">(Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen 2018)</span>. The article
notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If your data are very large, or streaming, an alternative is to include a
small-sample dataset so that people can try out the techniques without having to
run very expensive computations.” <span class="citation">(Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Code subdirectories</em></p>
<p>Next, you’ll want to include one or more subdirectories for code. Again, this
structure helps in separating data collection from data analysis (module 2.1).
This code may include data for cleaning and pre-processing the data, although
some researchers choose to put code for these steps in the “raw-data”
subdirectory, as separate files from the raw data files but within the same
section of the project directory. This code will also include code to analyze
and visualize the data. In some cases, it might include code for functions that
you plan to reuse within different code scripts in the project or even across
projects.</p>
<p>One article recommended having a single code subdirectory, named
“code” <span class="citation">(Blischak, Carbonetto, and Stephens 2019)</span>. This subdirectory can
store any code scripts (outside of any code running as part of a report
RMarkdown file; see modules 3.7–3.9). Another recommends that, if you
have both compiled code (like C code) and code scripts (for a language
like R), you may want to have separate subdirectories for source code (“src”)
versus compiled code or scripts (“bin”) <span class="citation">(Noble 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>Other researchers have recommended having an “R” subdirectory that is only used
for code that you write for reusable R functions, ones that you plan to use
several times across other code scripts in your project <span class="citation">(Vuorre and Crump 2021; Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen 2018)</span>. For the code that runs data analysis, they recommend a
separate subdirectory named “model” <span class="citation">(Vuorre and Crump 2021)</span> or “analysis”
<span class="citation">(Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen 2018)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Report subdirectories</em></p>
<p>You can leverage the standard structure you’ve created for your directory to
create a report. This can be designed to generate some exploratory analysis and
visualizations that you find you typically want to generate from your data. You
can create this using tools for reproducible reports—in R, a key tool for this
is RMarkdown. Here, we’ll cover using this tool for creating a report, and there
are many more details in modules 3.7 through 3.9. Briefly, RMarkdown allows you
to include both code and text meant for humans within a single, plain text
document. This document can then be rendered, a process that executes the code
and formats the text meant for humans, producing a document in an easy-to-read
format like Word or PDF.</p>
<p>Whether you use these tools or not, though, you should have a space in your
project directory to keep the documents you create to report your findings.
These will include initial reports, but they can also include documents like
paper articles, conference abstracts, posters, and presentations.</p>
<p>You could use a single subdirectory for these report files, named something like
“doc” <span class="citation">(Johnston 2022; Noble 2009)</span>. Alternatively, if you are using RMarkdown
files, you could keep these files (which are the ones you should work on as you
edit reports) in one subdirectory and have another subdirectory to store the
output of those RMarkdown files (the generated reports in a format like PDF or
Word, which you should treat as read-only if they were generated from an
RMarkdown file) <span class="citation">(Blischak, Carbonetto, and Stephens 2019)</span>. These two subdirectories could be named
“analysis” and “output”, respectively <span class="citation">(Blischak, Carbonetto, and Stephens 2019)</span>. Another article
recommends using separate subdirectories for different types of report outputs,
for example “posters”, “manuscript”, and “slides” <span class="citation">(Vuorre and Crump 2021)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Metadata subdirectories or files</em></p>
<p>The final major area to cover in your project directory are files for metadata.
These files contain information that describes your project as a whole. In some
cases you might store this information in subdirectories, but in many cases,
this information might alternatively go in a single file at the main level of
the project directory.</p>
<p>There are a number of pieces of information that you may want to include in this
metadata. You could include, for example, information about the experiment, like
which model animal you were using or which treatment you were testing. You could
also include information related to the code analysis. One piece of information
that’s very important, for example, is a list of the dependencies and versions
of software. For example, if you used R for analysis, which version of R did you
use, and which packages did you use to supplement the base R distribution?</p>
<p>The metadata can also provide some information on who was involved
in the project, what role each person had, and the conditions for reusing
elements of the project, like code and data. If the project directory will
be shared once you complete the information, these details on reuse will be
particularly helpful. This might include information, for example, about the
license under which you are sharing any code within the project.</p>
<p>Several articles suggest sharing this metadocumentation through a type of file
called a “README” file <span class="citation">(Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen 2018; Bertin and Baumer 2021; Johnston 2022)</span>.
The idea of a README file comes from the tradition of software engineering.
The code that builds a software system can be large and complex, with many
source files that must be combined and compiled to “build” the software.
Since it can be hard to navigate the directory with all these files, one
long-standing solution is to include a README file. This README file is
put in the top level of the directory’s hierarchy. This way, when someone opens
the directory, they’ll see this file right away, and it has a very discoverable
filename, since “README” tells you exactly what you should do with it.</p>
<p>This file serves as a spot where you can help someone navigate the rest of the
files in the directory. You can also use it to record metadata for the project:
things like who was involved in the research and a citation to a resulting
paper. You can write this file in plain text, but if you’re sharing the project
directory through a version control platform, you might want to explore
writing it in the mark-up language Markdown (see module 2.11 for more on
using Markdown for a README file that will be shared through a version control
platform).</p>
<p><strong>Decide on file name conventions</strong></p>
<p>The final step in designing a conceptual framework is to create some rules for
how you’ll name files in the project. When you create rules for how you name
files, the first thing to keep in mind is this: use names that balance
<em>generalizability</em> with <em>discoverability</em>.</p>
<p>In terms of generalizability, you want to use file names that generalize to all
of your projects. In other words, don’t make file names so specific that they
won’t work the next time you do a project. You may, for example, want to include
the name of the grant or experiment in your filename for your metadata. This
instinct is good—it can be helpful to include information about your
experiment somewhere in the filenames. But try to put this type of information
as high in the directory structure as possible: specifically, put that information in
the name of the project directory itself. Then, within the filenames in that
directory, use names that can be used across many projects.</p>
<p>This is because if a type of file always has the same name in all your project
directories, you and your team will find it easy to find that file and use
that file as they move from one project to the next. It even will allow you
to write code that leverages the fact that certain files always have the
same name across projects.</p>
<p>You don’t, however, want to make file names so general that they aren’t
<em>discoverable</em> (see module 2.6 for more on the idea of <em>discoverability</em>).
A filename, in other words, shouldn’t be so generic that its name doesn’t
give you an good idea of what it contains.</p>
<p>Say, for example, that you used the name “file_a” for the metadata file in your
project directory. This filename is generic and would work across many projects,
unlike a filename that includes something like the name of the experiment. It’s
so generic, though, that it would be hard for someone to figure out what the
file contains just by looking at its name. A better name would be something like
“experiment_metadata”—generic enough to work across many projects, but
detailed enough to be discoverable.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider, as you select file naming conventions, is to avoid
special characters in filenames. We discussed this idea in module 2.4, in
the context of avoiding special characters in the column names and cell entries
in a data collection spreadsheet. Similar considerations apply to filenames.
While many operating systems allow you to include things like spaces in
filenames, these special characters can make it harder to write code that works
with the file. Try to write filenames that have only alphanumeric characters and
underscores.</p>
<p>One of the biggest culprits here are spaces. It is appealing to include spaces
in a filename: it’s easier to read the words in the filename if they’re
separated by spaces. You should, though, get out of this habit. Once you move to
coding with the file, the spaces will be a pain. Often, when a computer parses
code, it thinks it’s gotten to the end of something when it gets to a space.
When it gets to a space in a filename, for example, it can think it’s gotten to
the end of that filename in some contexts. So, if you put a space in the middle
of a filename, it can confuse the computer.</p>
<p>There are ways to help the computer out—ways to “escape” special characters,
to the computer will treat them literally rather than attributing special
meaning to these special characters. However, it’s no fun to have to do over
and over again as you use a set of files. It’s much simpler to enforce a rule to
use underscores instead of spaces in your filenames: “experiment_metadata.Md”,
for example, rather than “experiment metadata.Md”. The underscores serve the
same purpose of legibility that the spaces do, by separating words within the
filename. They won’t confuse the computer in the same way, though.</p>
<p>Another consideration is that it is good practice to write code using relative pathnames that start from the
top-level of the project directory <span class="citation">(Bertin and Baumer 2021)</span>. In other words, tell
the computer where to find the files starting from the top level of the project
directory. This is because these relative pathnames will work equally well on
someone else’s computer, whereas if you use file pathnames that are absolute
(i.e., giving directions to the file from the root directory on your computer),
then when someone else tries on run the code on their own computer, it won’t
work and they’ll need to change the filepaths in the code, since everyone’s
computer has its files organized differently. For example, if you, on your
personal computer, have the project directory stored in your “Documents” folder,
while a colleague has stored the project directory in his or her “Desktop”
directory, then the absolute filepaths for each file in the directory will be
different for each of you. The relative pathnames, starting from the top level
of the project directory, will be the same for both of you, though, regardless
of where you each stored the project directory on your computer.</p>
<p>When it comes to code scripts in your project, there’s also one other think you
may want to consider in naming conventions. Often, you will have divided key
tasks (like data entry, pre-processing, and analysis) into separate scripts. The
scripts will need to follow a specific order when they are run to recreate the
results for the project. In this case, you may want to consider starting each
script’s filename with a number, where the numbers indicate the order that the
scripts should be run <span class="citation">(Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen 2018; Bertin and Baumer 2021)</span>. For example, your script files might look like:
“01_reading_data.R”, “02_preprocessing_data.R”, “03_exploratory_analysis.R”, and
so on.</p>
<p>There are other cases where you’ll have more than one of a certain file type.
For example, within your raw data files, you may have one file per sample for
an assay like flow cytometry, or one file per timepoint if you’re recording
data for multiple timepoints.</p>
<p>In this case, you’ll need to develop rules for how you name these files,
chosing a system that allows different filenames for each file. As you do,
there are two things you can keep in mind: first, adhering to standards when
possible, and second designing filenames in a way that you can leverage
something called <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>
<p>In an earlier module (2.2), we talked about standards in terms of recording
data. We emphasized how powerful standards can be if they are regularly
followed in practice. Just as standards are a powerful tool when recording
data, they are also a powerful tool when creating filenames.
If there are conventions in your discipline for how certain files are named,
follow these.</p>
<p>One example is that there may be a standard way that a piece of laboratory
equipment names a file. For example, it may always include some elements like
the sample name and the date that the sample was run through the equipment.
In this case, you don’t want to change these filenames. You want to keep them
in the standard format, as people may have already built tools to work with
that standard. If you change from the standard, those tools wouldn’t be available.
Standards also tend to help with discoverability, so if you change the filenames
for the standard, it may make it harder for someone else to navigate your files.</p>
<p>If standards don’t exist for naming a certain type of file, you can create your
own standards. As you do, you can think about how to create filenames that
leverage <em>regular expressions</em>. These are coding tools that can search for
patterns that you specify in character strings, including filenames.</p>
<p>As an example, say you have files that record separate timepoints of your
experiment. You could pick a naming convention that always includes the
timepoint in the filename, recorded using the same conventions and always in
the same place in the filename. If you collect at timepoints that you call
“day 7”, “day 14”, and “day 21”, you might incorporate these within the filenames
using “D” for “day” and the two digits for the number. This would result in
files that include something like “D07”, “D14”, or “D21” in the name. It would
be straightforward to pull this information back out of the filenames if you
always put it in the same spot in the filename. For example, if you’re collecting
bacterial loads by measuring colony-forming units, you might name the files,
“cfu_D07.xlsx”, “cfu_D14.xlsx”, and “cfu_D21.xlsx”. Because you have
always put the varying information (the timepoint) in the same spot, it
will be easy to extract this with code using regular expressions.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3</span> Creating and using a project template</h3>
<p>Once you have a blueprint for a template for a project directory, you can create
this as a “physical template” directory on your computer.
This process is, once you have designed the template, very easy. It involves no
fancy tools—in fact, it’s so straightforward that at first it might seem too
simple to be useful. For this basic approach, you will create an example file
directory that captures your desired project directory structure. If you have
created any templates, either for data collection (module 2.4 and 2.5) or for
reports (modules 3.7–3.9), you can include those within this structure.</p>
<p>In other words, you will create a basic file directory with the desired template
files and file directory structure. When you are ready to start a new project,
you will copy this template, rename the copy to be specific to the new project,
and then use this directory to store and work with the data you collect for the
project. Figure <a href="2.7-module7.html#fig:templatedirectory">2.23</a> gives an example of what the final
resulting template directory might look like, as well as how it can be copied,
renamed, and used as you start new projects.</p>

</div>
<p>This template is not restrictive—it serves as a starting point, but it can
be adapted for each specific project. For example, if you are collecting
data from an assay that you have not used in past experiments, you can add
a new data subdirectory to your project directory to use for storing that new
type of data. Figure <a href="2.7-module7.html#fig:projecttemplatecomplex">2.24</a> shows an example of
how you could customize the basic template shown in Figure <a href="2.7-module7.html#fig:templatedirectory">2.23</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that you do want to keep a balance, where you avoid
unneeded changes to the project template within each specific project’s
directory. This is because many of the benefits of standardizing (e.g.,
knowing where things are, building tools that leverage the standardized
directory structure) are lost as the directories for specific projects grow
to be more and more different from each other.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="2.7-module7.html#fig:basicprojecttemplateuse">2.25</a> gives a basic walk-through of the
simple steps you’ll use to start a new project directory once you’ve created
this type of template (we will cover this example in much more detail in the
next module, where we walk through a full example of designing and using a
project template).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.4</span> Project directories as RStudio Projects</h3>
<p>If you are using the R programming language for data pre-processing, analysis,
and visualization—as well as RMarkdown for writing reports and
presentations—then you can use RStudio’s “Project” functionality to make it
even more convenient to work with files within a research project’s directory.
You can make any file directory a “Project” in RStudio by chosing “File” -&gt;
“New Project” in RStudio’s menu. This gives you the option to create a
project from scratch or to make an existing directory and RStudio Project.</p>
<p>When you make a file directory an RStudio Project, it doesn’t change much in
the directory itself except adding a “.RProj” file. This file keeps track of
some things about the file directory for RStudio, including preferred settings
for RStudio to use when working in that project.</p>
<p>When you are working in an RStudio Project, RStudio will automatically move your
working directory to be the top-level directory of the Project directory. This
makes it easy to write code that uses this directory as the presumed working
directory, using relative file paths to identify and files within the directory.
We discussed the value of using relative pathnames earlier in this module, when
we discussed how to design file naming conventions for your project directory.
In particular, if you share the project directory with someone else, they can
similarly open the RStudio Project in their own version of RStudio, and all the
relative pathnames to files should work on their system without any problems.
This feature helps make code in an RStudio Project directory reproducible across
different people’s computers.</p>
<p>There are some other advantages, as well, to turning each of your research
project directories into RStudio Projects. One is that it is very easy to
connect each of these Projects with GitHub, which facilitates collaborative work
on the project across multiple team members while tracking all changes under
version control. If you are tracking the project directory under the Git version
control system, then when you open the RStudio Project, there will be a special
tab in one of the panes to help in using Git with the project. This tab provides
a visual interface for you to commit changes you’ve made, so they are tracked
and can be reversed if needed, and also so you can easily push and pull these
committed changes to and from a remote repository, like a GitHub repository, if
you are collaborating with others. This functionality is described in modules
2.9 through 2.11.</p>
<p>Having your project directories set up as R Projects also makes it easy to
navigate among different projects. When you close RStudio and reopen it, it will
automatically open in the last Project you had open. There is a small tab in the
top right hand corner of the RStudio window that lists the project you are
currently in. To move to a different Project, you can click on the down arrow
beside this project name. There will be a list of your most recent projects, as
well as options to open any Project on your computer. If you want to work in
RStudio, but not in any of the Projects, you can choose to “Close Project”.</p>
