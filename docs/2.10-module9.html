<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.10</span> Harnessing version control for transparent data recording</h2>
<p>As a research project progresses, a typical practice in many experimental
research groups is to save new versions of files (e.g., ‘draft1.doc,’
‘draft2.doc’), so that changes can be reverted. However, this practice leads to
an explosion of files, and it becomes hard to track which files represent the
‘current’ state of a project. Version control allows researchers to edit and
change research project files more cleanly, while maintaining the power to
‘backtrack’ to previous versions, messages included to explain changes. We will
explain what version control is and how it can be used in research projects to
improve the transparency and reproducibility of research, particularly for data
recording.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe version control<br />
</li>
<li>Explain how version control can be used to improve reproducibility
for data recording</li>
</ul>
<div id="what-is-version-control" class="section level3" number="2.10.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.10.1</span> What is version control?</h3>
<p>Version control developed as a way to coordinate collaborative work on software
programming projects. The term “version” here refers to the current state of a
document or set of documents, for example the source code for a computer
program. The idea of “control” is to allow for safe changes and updates to this
version while more than one person is working on it. The general term “version
control” can refer to any method of syncing contributions from several people to
a file or set of files, and very early on it was done by people rather than
through a computer program. While version control of computer files can be done
by people, and originally was <span class="citation">(Irving 2011)</span>, it’s much more
efficient to use a computer program to handle this tracking of the history of a
set of files as they evolve.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tracking all that detail is just the sort of thing computers
are good at and humans are not.” <span class="citation">(E. S. Raymond 2003)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the very earliest version control systems tracked single files, these
systems quickly moved to tracking sets of files, called <em>repositories</em>. You can
think of a repository as a computer file directory with some extra overhead
added to record how the files in the directory have changed over time. In a
repository of files that is under version control, you take regular “snapshots”
of how the files look during your work on them. Each snapshot is called a
<em>commit</em>, and it provides a record of which lines in each file changed from one
snapshot to another, as well as exactly how they changed. The idea behind these
commits—recording the differences, line-by-line, between an older and newer
version of each file derives from a longstanding Unix command line tool called
<code>diff</code>. This tool, developed early in the history of Unix at AT&amp;T
<span class="citation">(E. S. Raymond 2003)</span>, is and extremely solid and well-tested tool that did the
simple but important job of generating a list of all the differences between two
plain text files.</p>
<p>When you are working with a directory under version control, you can also
explain your changes as you make them—in other words, it allows for
<em>annotation</em> of the developing and editing process <span class="citation">(E. Raymond 2009)</span>. Each
commit requires you to enter a <em>commit message</em> describing why the change was
made. The commit messages can serve as a powerful tool for explaining changes to
other team members or for reminding yourself in the future about why certain
changes were made. As a result, a repository under version control includes a
complete history of how files in a project directory have changed over the
timecourse of the project and why. Further, each of the commits is given its own
ID tag (a unique SHA-1 hash), and version control systems have a number of
commands that let you “roll back” to earlier versions, by going back to the
version as it was when a certain commit was made, provided <em>reversability</em>
within the project files <span class="citation">(E. Raymond 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>It turns out that this functionality—of being able to “roll back” to earlier
versions—has a wonderful side benefit when it comes to working on a large
project. It means that you <em>don’t</em> need to save earlier versions of each file.
You can maintain one and only one version of each project file in the project’s
directory, with the confidence that you never “lose” old versions of the file
<span class="citation">(J. Perkel 2018; Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson 2016)</span>. This allows you to maintain a clean and
simple version of the project files, with only one copy of each, ensuring it’s
always clear which version of a file is the “current” one (since there’s only
one version). This also provides the reassurance that you can try new directions
in a project, and always roll back to the old version if that direction doesn’t
work well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Early in his graduate career, John Blischak found himself creating figures
for his advisor’s grant application. Blischak was using the programming language
R to generate the figures, and as he iterated and optimized his code, he ran
into a familiar problem: Determined not to lose his work, he gave each new
version a different filename—analysis_1, analysis_2, and so on, for
instance—but failed to document how they had evolved. ‘I had no idea what had
changed between them,’ says Blischak… Using Git, Blischak says, he no longer
needed to maintain multiple copies of his files. ‘I just keep overwriting it and
changing it and saving the snapshots. And if the professor comes back and says,
’oh, you sent me an email back in March with this figure,’ I can say, ‘okay,
well, I’ll just bo back to the March version of my code and I can recreate
it.’” <span class="citation">(J. Perkel 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, most current version control systems operate under a <em>distributed</em>
framework. In earlier types of version control programs, there was one central
(“main”) repository for the file or set of files the team was working on
<span class="citation">(E. Raymond 2009; Target 2018)</span>. Very early on, this was kept on one
computer <span class="citation">(Irving 2011)</span>. A team member who wanted to make a change
would “check out” the file he or she wanted to work on, make changes, and then
check it back in as the newest main version <span class="citation">(E. S. Raymond 2003)</span>. While one team
member had this file checked out, other members would often be “locked” out of
making any changes to that file—they could look at it, but couldn’t make any
edits <span class="citation">(E. Raymond 2009; Target 2018)</span>. This meant that there was no
chance of two people trying to change the same part of a file at the same time.
In spirit, this early system is pretty similar to the idea of sending a file
around the team by email, with the understanding that only one person works on
it at a time. While the “main” version is in different people’s hands at
different times, to do work, you all agree that only one person will work on it
at a time. A slightly more modern analogy is the idea of having a single version
of a file in Dropbox or Google Docs, and avoiding working on the file when you
see that another team member is working on it.</p>
<p>This system is pretty clunky, though. In particular, it usually increases the
amount of time that it takes the team to finish the project, because only one
person can work on a file at a time. Later types of version control programs
moved toward a different style, allowing for <em>distributed</em> rather than
<em>centralized</em> collaborative work on a file or a set of files
<span class="citation">(E. Raymond 2009; Irving 2011)</span>. Under the distributed model,
all team members can have their own version of all the files, work on them and
make records of changes they make to the files, and then occassionally sync with
everyone else to share your changes with them and bring their changes into your
copy of the files. This distributed model also means there is a copy of the full
repository on every team members computer, which has the side benefit of
provided natural backup of the project files. Remote repositories—which may be
on a server in a different location—can be added with another copy of the
project, which can similarly be synced regularly to update with any changes made
to project files.</p>
<p>While there are a number of software systems for version control, by far the
most common currently used for scienctific projects is <em>git</em>. This program was
created by Linus Torvalds, who also created the Linux operating system, in 2005
as a way to facilitate the team working on Linux development. This program for
version control thrives in large collaborative projects, for example open-source
software development projects that include numerous contributors, both regular
and occasional <span class="citation">(Brown 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>In recent years, some complementary tools have been developed that make the
process of collaborating together using version control software easier. Other
tools can helps in collaborating on file-based projects, including <em>bug
trackers</em> or <em>issue trackers</em>, which allow the team to keep a running “to-do”
list of what needs to be done to complete the project, all of which are
discussed in the next chapter as tools that can be used to improve collaboration
on scientific projects spread across teams. GitHub, a very popular version
control platform with these additional tools, was created in 2008 as a web-based
platform to facilitate collaborating on projects running under git version
control. It can provide an easier entry to using git for version control than
trying to learn to use git from the command line <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>. It also plays
well with RStudio, making it easy to integrate a collaborative workflow through
GitHub from the same RStudio window on your computer where you are otherwise
doing your analysis <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If your software engineering career, like mine, is no older than GitHub, then
git may be the only version control software you have ever used. While people
sometimes grouse about its steep learning curve or unintuitive interface, git has
become everyone’s go-to for version control.” <span class="citation">(Target 2018)</span></p>

<div id="recording-data-in-the-laboratoryfrom-paper-to-computers" class="section level3" number="2.10.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.10.2</span> Recording data in the laboratory—from paper to computers</h3>
<p>Traditionally, experimental data collected in a laboratory was recorded in a
paper laboratory notebook. These laboratory notebooks played a role not only as
the initial recording of data, but also can serve as, for example, a legal
record of the data recorded in the lab <span class="citation">(Mascarelli 2014)</span>. They were also
a resource for collaborating across a team and for passing on a research project
from one lab member to another <span class="citation">(Butler 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>However, paper laboratory notebooks have a number of limitations. First, they
can be very inefficient. In a time when almost all data analyses—even simple
calculations—are done on a computer, recording research data on paper rather
than directly entering it into a computer is inefficient. Also, any stage of
copying data from one format to another, especially when done by a human rather
than a machine, introduces the chance to copying errors. Handwritten laboratory
notebooks can be hard to read <span class="citation">(Butler 2005; J. M. Perkel 2011)</span>, and
may lack adequate flexibility and expandability to handle the complex
experiments often conducted. Further, electronic alternatives can also be easier
to search, allowing for deeper and more comprehensive investigations of the data
collected across multiple experiments <span class="citation">(Giles 2012; Butler 2005; J. M. Perkel 2011)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Handwritten lab notebooks are usually chaotic and always unsearchable.”
<span class="citation">(J. M. Perkel 2011)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given a widespread recognition of the limitations of paper laboratory notebooks,
in the past couple of decades, there have been a number of efforts, both formal
and informal, to move from paper laboratory notebooks to electronic
alternatives. In some fields that rely heavily on computational analysis, there
are very few research labs (if any) that use paper laboratory notebooks
<span class="citation">(Butler 2005)</span>. In other fields, where researchers have traditionally
used paper lab notebooks, companies have been working for a while to develop
electronic laboratory notebooks specifically tailored to scientific research
needs <span class="citation">(Giles 2012)</span>. These were adopted more early in pharmaceutical
industrial labs, where companies had the budgets to get customized versions and
the authority to require their use, but have taken longer to be adapted in
academic laboratories <span class="citation">(Giles 2012; Butler 2005)</span>. A widely
adopted platform for electronic laboratory notebooks has yet to be taken up
by the scientific community, despite clear advantages of recording data directly
into a computer rather than first using a paper notebook.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since at least the 1990s, articles on technology have predicted the imminent,
widespread adoption of electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) by researchers. It has
yet to happen—but more and more scientists are taking the plunge.” <span class="citation">(Kwok 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of using customized electronic laboratory notebook software, some
academics are moving their data recording online, but are using more generalized
electronic alternatives, like Dropbox, Google applications, OneNote, and
Evernote <span class="citation">(J. M. Perkel 2011; Kwok 2018; Giles 2012; K. Powell 2012)</span>.
Some scientists have started using version control tools, especially the
combination of git and GitHub, as a way to improve laboratory data recording,
and in particular to improve transparency and reproducibility standards.
These pieces of software share the same pattern as Google tools or
Dropbox—they are generalized tools that have been honed and optimized for ease
of use through their role outside of scientific research, but can be harnessed
as a powerful tool in a scientific laboratory, as well. They are also free—at
least, for GitHub, at the entry and academic levels—and, even better, one
(git) is open source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The purpose of a lab notebook is to provide a lasting record of events in a
laboratory. In the same way that a chemistry experiment would be nearly
impossible without a lab notebook, scientific computing would be a nightmare of
inefficiency and uncertainty without version-control systems.”
<span class="citation">(Tippmann 2014)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While some generalized tools like Google tools and Dropbox might be simpler to
initially learn, version control tools offer some key advantages for recording
scientific data and are worth the effort to adopt. A key advantage is their
ability to track the full history of files as they evolve, including not only
the history of changes to each file, but also a record of why each change was
made. Git excels in tracking changes made to plain text
files. For these files, whether they record code, data, or text, git can show
line-by-line differences between two versions of the file. This makes it very
easy to go through the history of “commits” to a plain text file in a
git-tracked repository and see what change was made at each time point, and then
read through the commit messages associated with those commits to see why a
change was made. For example, if a value was entered in the wrong row of a csv,
and the researcher then made a commit to correct that data entry mistake, the
researcher could explain the problem and its resolution in the commit message
for that change.</p>
<p>Platforms for using git often include nice tools for visualizing differences
between two files, providing a more visual way to look at the “diffs” between
files across time points in the project. For example, GitHub automatically shows
these using colors to highlight addititions and substractions of plain text for
one file compared to another version of it when you look through a repository’s
commit history. Similarly, RStudio provides a new “Commit” window that can be
used to compare differences between the original and revised version of plain
text files at a particular stage in the commit history.</p>
<!-- [Maybe include a figure with an example of how the difference between two  -->
<!-- text files can be seen, along with a commit message explaining the change?] -->
<p>The use of version control tools and platforms, like git and GitHub, not only
helps in transparent and trackable recording of data, but it also brings some
additional advantages in the research project. First, this combination of tools
aids in collaboration across a research group, as we discuss in depth in the next
chapter.</p>
<p>Second, if a project uses these tools, it is very easy to share data recorded
for the project publicly. In a project that uses git and GitHub version control
tools, it is easy to share the project data online once an associated manuscript
is published, an increasingly common request or requirement from journals and
funding agencies <span class="citation">(Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson 2016)</span>. Sharing data allows a more complete
assessment of the research by reviewers and readers and makes it easier for
other researchers to build off the published results in their own work,
extending and adapting the code to explore their own datasets or ask their own
research questions <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>. On GitHub, you can set the access to a
project to be either public or private, and can be converted easily from one
form to the other over the course of the project <span class="citation">(Metz 2015)</span>. A private
project can be viewed only by fellow team members, while a public project can be
viewed by anyone. Further, because git tracks the full history of changes to
these documents, it includes functionality that let’s you tag the code and data
at a specific point (for example, the date when a paper was submitted) so that
viewers can look at that specific “version” of the repository files, even while
the project team continues to move forward in improving files in the directory.
At the more advanced end of functionality, there are even ways to assign a DOI
to a specific version of a GitHub repository <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>Third, the combination of git and GitHub can help as a way to backup study data
<span class="citation">(Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson 2016; Perez-Riverol et al. 2016; J. Perkel 2018)</span>. Together, git and GitHub
provide a structure where the project directory (repository) is copied on
multiple computers, both the users’ laptop or desktop computers and on a remote
server hosted by GitHub or a similar organization. This set-up makes it easy to
bring all the project files onto a new computer—all you have to do is clone
the project repository. It also ensures that there are copies of the full
project directory, including all its files, in multiple places
<span class="citation">(Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson 2016)</span>. Further, not only is the data backed up across multiple
computers, but so is the full history of all changes made to that data and the
recorded messages explaining those changes, through the repositories commit
messages <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>There are, of course, some limitations to using version control tools when
recording experimental data. First, while ideally laboratory data is recorded in
a plain text format (see the module in section 2.2 for a deeper discussion of
why), some data may be recorded in a binary file format. Some version control
tools, including git, can be used to track changes in binary files. However, git
does not take to these types of files naturally. In particular, git typically
will not be able to show users a useful comparison of the differences between
two versions of a binary file. More problems can arise if the binary file is
very large <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016; Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson 2016)</span>, as some experimental research
data files are (e.g., if they are high-throughput output of laboratory equipment
like a mass spectrometer). However, there are emerging tools and strategies for
improving the ability to include and track large binary files when using git and
GitHub <span class="citation">(Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson 2016)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You can version control any file that you put in a Git repository, whether it is
text-based, an image, or a giant data file. However, just because you <em>can</em> version
control something, does not mean that you <em>should</em>.” <span class="citation">(Blischak, Davenport, and Wilson 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- [Add something about whether version control timestamps would meet legal standards,  -->
<!-- e.g., for patent claims? Mike had a comment about using locks with data that might -->
<!-- go with that.] -->
<p>Finally, as with other tools and techniques described in this book, there is an
investment required to learn how to use git and GitHub <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>, as well
as a bit of extra overhead when using version control tools in a project
<span class="citation">(E. S. Raymond 2003)</span>. However, both can bring dramatic gains to efficiency,
transparency, and organization of research projects, even if you only use a
small subset of its basic functionality <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span>. In Chapter 11 we
provide guidance on getting started with using git and Github to track a
scientific research project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Although Git has a complex set of commands and can be used for rather complex
operations, learning to apply the basics requires only a handful of new concepts
and commands and will provide a solid ground to efficiently track code and related
content for research projects.” <span class="citation">(Perez-Riverol et al. 2016)</span></p>

<p>“Using an RCS [revision control system] has changed how I work. … a day’s
work is no longer a featureless slog toward the summit, but a sequence of small
steps. What one feature could I add? What one problem could I fix? Once a step is

<p>With version control, “Our filesystem now has a time dimension. We can query the

<p>“Git is a C program like any other, and is based on a small set of objects.
The key object is the commit object, which is akin to a unified diff file.
Given a previous commit object and some changes from that baseline, a new commit
object encapsulates the information. It gets some support from the <em>index</em>, which
is a list of the changes registered since the last commit object, the primary
use of which will be in generating the next commit object. The commit objects
link together to form a tree much like any other tree. Each commit object will
have (at least) one parent commit object. Stepping up and down the tree is akin to
using <code>patch</code> and <code>patch -R</code> to step among versions.” <span class="citation">(Klemens 2014)</span></p>
