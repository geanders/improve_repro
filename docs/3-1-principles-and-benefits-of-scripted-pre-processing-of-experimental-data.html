<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Principles and benefits of scripted pre-processing of experimental data</h2>
<p>The experimental data collected for biomedical research often requires
pre-processing before it can be analyzed (e.g., gating of flow cytometry data,
feature finding / quantification for mass spectrometry data). Use of
point-and-click software can limit the transparency and reproducibility of this
analysis stage and is time-consuming for repeated tasks. We will explain how
scripted pre-processing, especially using open source software, can improve
transparency and reproducibility.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define ‘pre-processing’ of experimental data</li>
<li>Describe an open source code script and explain how it can increase
reproducibility of data pre-processing</li>
</ul>
<div id="what-is-pre-processing" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> What is pre-processing?</h3>
<p>Some data collected through laboratory experiments is very straightforward and
requires little or no pre-processing before it’s used in analysis. For example,
[example]. Other data may require some minimal pre-processing. For example, if
you plate bacteria from a sample at a variety of dilutions, you might count each
plate and determine a measure of Colony Forming Units from the set of plates
with different dilutions by deciding which dilution provides the clearest count
and then back-calculating based on its dilution to get the total number of
colony-forming units in the original sample.</p>
<p>This step of pre-processing data can become much more complex with data that was
collected using complex equipment, like a flow cytometer or a mass spectrometer.
In these cases, there are often steps required to extract from the machine’s
readings a biologically-relevant measurement. For example, the data output from
a mass spectrometer must be processed to move from measurements of mass and
retention time to estimates of concentrations of different molecules in the
sample. If you want to compare across multiple samples, then the preprocessing
will also involve steps to align the different samples (in terms of …), as
well as to standardize the measurements for each sample, to make the
measurements from the different samples comparable. For data collected from a
flow cytometer, preprocessing may include steps to disentangle the florescence
from different markers to ensure that the read for one marker isn’t inflated by
spillover florescence from a different marker.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Approaches to simple preprocessing tasks</h3>
<p>There are several approaches for tackling this type of data preprocessing, to
get from the data that you initial observe (or that is measured by a piece of
laboratory equipment) to meaningful biological measurements that can be analyzed
and presented to inform explorations of a scientific hypothesis. While there are
a number of approaches that don’t involve writing code scripts for this
preprocessing, there are some large advantages to scripting preprocessing any
time you are preprocessing experimental data prior to including it in figures or
further analysis. In this section, we’ll describe some common non-scripted
approaches and discuss the advantages that would be brought by instead using a
code script. In the next module, we’ll walk through an example of how scripts
for preprocessing can be created and applied in laboratory research.</p>
<p>In cases where the pre-processing is mathematically straightforward and the
dataset is relatively small, many researchers do the preprocessing by hand in a
laboratory notebook or through an equation or macro embedded in a spreadsheet.
For example, if you have plated samples at different dilutions and are trying to
calculate from these the CFUs in the original sample, this calculation is simple
enough that it could be done by hand. However, there are advantages to instead
writing a code script to do this simple preprocessing.</p>
<p>When you write a script to do a task with data, it is like writing a recipe that
can be applied again and again. By writing a script, you encode the process a
single time, so you can take the time to check and recheck to make sure that
you’ve encoded the process correctly. This helps in avoiding small errors when
you do the preprocessing—if you are punching numbers into a calculator over
and over, it’s easy to mistype a number or forget a step every now and then,
while the code will ensure that the same process is run every time and that it
faithfully uses the numbers saved in the data for each step, rather than relying
on a person correctly entering each number in the calculation.</p>
<p>Scripts can be used across projects, as well, and so they can ensure consistency
in the calculation across projects. If different people do the calculation in
the lab for different projects or experiments, and they are doing the
calculations by hand, they might each do the calculation slightly differently,
even if it’s only in small details like how they report rounded numbers. A
script will do the exact same thing every time it is applied. You can even share
your script with colleagues at other labs, if you want to ensure that your data
preprocessing is comparable for experiments conducted in different research
groups, and many scientific journals will allow supplemental material with
code used for data preprocessing and analysis, or links within the manuscript
to a repository of this code posted online.</p>
<p>There are also gains in efficiency when you use a script. For small
pre-processing steps, these might seem small for each experiment, and certainly
when you first write the script, it will likely take longer to write and test
the script than it would to just do the calculation by hand (even more if
you’re just starting to learn how to write code scripts). However, since the
script can be applied again and again, with very little extra work to apply it
to new data, you’ll save yourself time in the future, and over a lot of
experiments and projects, this can add up. This makes it particularly useful to
write scripts for preprocessing tasks that you find yourself doing again and
again in the lab.</p>
</div>
<div id="approaches-to-more-complex-preprocessing-tasks" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Approaches to more complex preprocessing tasks</h3>
<p>Other preprocessing tasks can be much more complex, particularly those that need
to conduct a number of steps to extract biologically meaningful measurements
from the measurements made by a complex piece of laboratory equipment, as well
as steps to make sure these measurements can be meaningfully compared across
samples.</p>
<p>For these more complex tasks, the equipment manufacturer will often provide
software that can be used for the preprocessing. This software might conduct
some steps using defaults, and others based on the user’s specifications. These
are often provided through “GUIs” (graphical user interfaces), where the user
does a series of point-and-click steps to process the data. In some software,
this series of point-and-click steps is recorded as the user does them, so that
these steps can be “re-run” later or on a different dataset.</p>
<p>For many types of biological data, including output from equipment like flow
cytometers and mass spectrometers, open-source software has been developed
that can be used for this preprocessing. Often, the most cutting edge methods
for data preprocessing are first available through open-source software packages,
if the methods are developed by researchers rather than by the companies, and
often many of the algorithms that are made available through the equipment
manufacturer’s proprietary software are encoded versions of an algorithm
first shared by researchers as open-source software.</p>
<p>It can take a while to develop a code script for preprocessing the raw data from
a piece of complex equipment like a mass spectrometer. However, the process of
developing this script requires a thoughtful consideration of the steps of
preprocessing, and so this is often time well-spent. Again, this initial time
investment will pay off later, as the script can then be efficiently applied to
future data you collect from the equipment, saving you time in pointing and
clicking through the GUI software. Further, it’s easier to teach someone else
how to conduct the preprocessing that you’ve done, and apply it to future
experiments, because the script serves as a recipe.</p>
<p>When you conduct data preprocessing in a script, this also gives you access to
all the other tools in the scripting language. For example, as you work through
preprocessing steps for a dataset, if you are doing it through an R script, you
can use any of the many visualization tools that are available through R. By
contrast, in GUI software, you are restricted to the visualization and other
tools included in that particular set of software, and those software developers
may not have thought of something that you’d like to do. Open-source scripting
languages like R, Python, and Julia include a huge variety of tools, and once
you have loaded your data in any of these platforms, you can use any of these
tools.</p>
<p>If you have developed a script for preprocessing your raw data, it also becomes
much easier to see how changes in choices in preprocessing might influence your
final results. It can be tricky to guess whether your final results are sensitive,
for example, to what choice you make for a particular tranform for part of your
data, or in how you standardize data in one sample to make different samples
easier to compare. If the preprocessing is in a script, then you can test making
these changes and running all preprocessing and analysis scripts, to see if it
makes a difference in the final conclusions. If it does, then it helps you
identify parts of preprocessing that need to be deeply thought through for the
type of data you’re collecting, and you may want to explore the documentation on
that particular step of preprocessing to determine what choice is best for your
data, rather than relying on defaults.</p>
</div>
<div id="scripting-preprocessing-tasks" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.4</span> Scripting preprocessing tasks</h3>
<p>Code scripts can be developed for any open-source scripting languages, including
Python, R, and Julia. These can be embedded in or called from literate programming
documents, like RMarkdown and Julia, which are described in other modules. The
word “script” is a good one here—it really is as if you are providing the script
for a play. In an interactive mode, you can send requests to run in the programming
language step by step using a console, while in a script you provide the whole list
of all of your “lines” in that conversation, and the programming language will run
them all in order without you needing to interact from the console.</p>
<p>For preprocessing the data, the script will have a few predictible parts. First,
you’ll need to read the data in. There are different functions that can be used
to read in data from different file formats. For example, data that is stored in
an Excel spreadsheet can be loaded into R using functions in a package called
<code>readxl</code>. Data that is stored in a plain-text delimited format (like a csv file)
can be loaded into R using functions in the <code>readr</code> package.</p>
<p>When preprocessing data from complex equipment, you can determine how to read the
data into R by investigating the file type that is output by the equipment.
Fortunately, many types of scientific equipment follow standardized file formats.
This means that open-source developers can develop a single package that can
load data from equipment from multiple manufacturers. For example, flow cytometry
data is often stored in [file format]. Other biological datasets use file
formats that are appropriate for very large datasets and that allow R to work
with parts of the data at a time, without loading the full data in. [netCDF?]
In these cases, the first step in a script might not be to load in all the data,
but rather to provide R with a connection to the larger datafile, so it can
pull in data as it needs it.</p>
<p>Once the data is loaded or linked in the script, the script can proceed through
steps required to preprocess this data. These steps will often depend on the type
of data, especially the methods and equipment used to collect it. For example, for
mass spectrometry data, these steps will include … . For flow cytometry data,
these steps would include … .</p>
<p>The functions for doing these steps will often come from extensions that
different researchers have made for R. Base R is a simpler collection of data
processing and statistics tools, but the open-source framework of R has allowed
users to make and share their own extensions. In R, these are often referred to
as “packages”. Many of these are shared through the Comprehensive R Archive
Network (CRAN), and packages on CRAN can be directly installed using the
<code>install.packages</code> function in R, along with the package’s names. While CRAN
is the common spot for sharing general-purpose packages, there is a specialized
repository that is used for many genomics and other biology-related R packages
called Bioconductor. These packages can also be easily installed through a call
in R, but in this case it requires an installation function from the <code>BiocManager</code>
package. Many of the functions that are useful for preprocessing biological
data from laboratory experiments are available through Bioconductor.</p>
<p>Table [x] includes some of the primary R packages on Bioconductor that can be
used in preprocessing different types of biological data. There are often
multiple choices, developed by different research groups, but this list provides
a starting point of several of the standard choices that you may want to
consider as you start developing code.</p>
<p>Much of the initial preprocessing might use very specific functions that are
tailored to the format that the data takes once it is loaded. Later in the
script, there will often be a transfer to using more general-purpose tools in
that coding language. For example, once data is stored in a “dataframe” format
in R, it can be processed using a powerful set of general purpose tools
collected in a suite of packages called the “tidyverse”. This set of packages
includes functions for filtering to specific subsets of the data, merging
separate datasets, adding new measurements for each observation that are
functions of the initial measurements, summarizing, and visualizing. The
tidyverse suite of R tools is very popular in general R use and is widely
taught, including through numerous free online resources. By moving from
specific tools to these more general tools as soon as possible in the script, a
researcher can focus his or her time in learning these general purpose tools
well, as these can be widely applied across many types of data.</p>
<p>By the end of the script, data will be in a format that has extracted
biologically relevant measurements. Ideally, this data will be in a general
purpose format, like a dataframe, to make it easier to work with using general
purpose tools in the scripting language when the data is used in further data
analysis or to create figures for reports, papers, and presentations. Often, you
will want to save a version of this preprocessed version of the data in your
project files, and so the last step of the script might be to write out the
cleaned data in a file that can be loaded in later scripts for analysis and
visualization. This is especially useful if these data preprocessing steps are
time consuming, as is often the case for the large raw datasets output by
laboratory equipment like flow cytometers and mass spectrometers.</p>
<p>Figure [x] gives an example of a data preprocessing script, highlighting these
different common areas that often show up in these scripts.</p>

On such systems, tasks the designers have anticipated are very easy—but tasks they have
not anticipated are often impossible or at best extremely painful. Unix, on the other hand, has
flexibility in depth. The many ways Unix provides to glue together programs means that components
of its basic toolkit can be combined to produce useful effects that the designers of the individual
toolkit parts never anticipated.” <span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>
