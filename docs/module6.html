</h1>
<p>In earlier modules, we discussed how to separate data collection from data
analysis. By separating data collection and analysis into separate files, we can
make the file for each step simpler. Further, by separating steps into different
files, we can save the files in plain text, which makes it easier to track them
using version control software (discussed in later modules). This helps create a
record of changes made to the data or analysis code during the research process.</p>
<p>While this process helps in reproducibility, it results in more files being
collected for an experiment. Instead of data and its analysis collected within a
single spreadsheet file, you may end up with multiple files of data collected
from the experiment, as well as separate files with scripts for processing,
analyzing, and visualizing the data. With more complex experiments, there may be
different data files containing the data collected from different assays. For example,
you may run an experiment where you collect data from each research animal on
bacterial load, as well as flow cytometry data, as well as a measure of antibody
levels through ELISA. As a result, you may have one raw data file from each
assay and, for some assays, even one file per study subject (e.g., flow
cytometry). The files for a research project will also include files with
writing and presentations (posters and slides) associated with the project, as
well as code scripts for pre-processing data, for conducting data analysis, and
for creating and sharing final figures and tables.</p>
<p>In this and the next few modules, we’ll discuss how you can organize the files
for an experiment using a single directory that is designed to follow a similar
format across all your projects. The modules will discuss the advantages of
well-designed project directories, tips for arranging files within a project
directory, and how to create a directory template that allows you to use
consistent file organization across many experiments.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Advantages of organizing project files<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#advantages-of-organizing-project-files"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>As the files for a project accumulate, do you have a clear plan for keeping them
organized? Based on one analysis, many biomedical researchers do not. One study,
for example, surveyed over 250 biomedical researchers at the University of
Washington. They noted that, “Some researchers admitted to having no
organizational methodology at all, while others used whatever method best suited
their individual needs.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Anderson et al., &lt;span&gt;“Issues in Biomedical Research Data Management and Analysis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>147</sup></a></span> One respondent answered, “They’re
not organized in any way—they’re just thrown into files under different
projects,” while another said “I grab them when I need them, they’re not
organized in any decent way,” and another, “It’s not even organized—a file on
a central computer of protocols that we use, common lab protocols but those are
just individual Word files within a folder so it’s not searchable <em>per se</em>.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>148</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This lack of organization can make scientists reluctant to share their research
files, impeding reproducibility. In an article on organizing project files for
research, Marwick notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Virtually all researchers use computers as a central tool in their
workflow. However, our formal education rarely includes any training in
how to organise our computer files to make it easy to reproduce results
and share our analysis pipeline with others. Without clear instructions,
many researchers struggle to avoid chaos in their file structures, and so
are understandable reluctant to expose their workflow for others to see.
This may be one of the reasons that so many requests for details about
method, including requests for data and code, are turned down or go
unanswered.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen, &lt;span&gt;“Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using &lt;span&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; (and Friends).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>149</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharing data and code is crucial to research reproducibility, especially for
projects that include extensive proprocessing and complex analysis of data, as
many biomedical research projects now do. As a further bonus, when research articles
include data, they tend to be more impactful, as measured by
citations that the paper receives.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>150</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In an earlier module, we introduced Adam Savage’s idea of “knolling” to keep a
workspace tidy (module <a href="module3.html#module3">3</a>). He was talking about a physical workspace. When
you are working with data, computer files and directories are your workspace.
For any type of work, the design of the workspace plays a critical role in
how the workers approach tasks and solve problems. Rod Judkins, who is a
lecturer at St Martin’s College of Art, highlights this in a book on
creative thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your working environment, whether it’s a supermarket, office, studio, or
building site, persuades you to work and think in certain ways. The more aware
you are of that, and the more you understand your medium, the more you can use
it to your advantage.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Rod Judkins, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Creative Thinking&lt;/em&gt; (Perigee, 2016).&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>151</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adam Savage describes how important this is in another type of work: gourmet
cooking. He describes how this idea of an organized workspace is captured by the
technique of <em>mise en place</em>—of laying out all the elements needed for the
work ahead of time and in an organized way—introduced by the famous French
chef August Escoffier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Kitchens are pressure cookers in which wasted movement and hasty technique
can ruin a dish, slice an artery, burn a hand, land you in the weeds, and
ultimately kill a restaurant. <em>Mise en place</em> is the only way to reliably create
a perfect dish, to exact specifications, over and over again, night after night,
for paying customers who demand nothing less.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Savage, &lt;em&gt;Every Tool’s a Hammer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>152</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good organization of your files can similarly encourage clear thinking, and it
can help you in reasoning through how to analyze data. One article notes that
“mundane issues such as organizing files and directories and documenting
progress … are important because poor organizational choices can lead to
significantly slower research progress.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;William Stafford Noble, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;PLoS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; 5, no. 7 (2009): e1000424.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>153</sup></a></span> In fact, if files are
organized in a consistent way across multiple projects, this can even allow you
to start automating some necessary tasks through code that is built to work with
that consistent structure.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Buffalo, &lt;em&gt;Bioinformatics Data Skills&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>154</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Organization also helps you in finding things, and finding them quickly. You can
even find things quickly when you come back to a project after a while away from
it (for example, while the paper was out for review). You can teach others how
to find things quickly and consistently across your multiple projects, as well
as where to put things they’re contributing.</p>
<p>Good file organization will also help you find information you need when it’s
time to write up your results. As one article notes, with good organization,
“methods and data sections in papers practically write themselves, with no time
wasted in frenzied hunting for missing information.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Monya Baker, &lt;span&gt;“How Quality Control Could Save Your Science,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 529, no. 7587 (2016): 456–59.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>155</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Finally, good file organization can improve your efficiency. An article on
organizing computational biology projects highlights this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Everything you do, you will probably have to do over again. Inevitably, you
will discover some flaw in your initial preparation of the data being analyzed,
or you will get access to new data, or you will decide that your
parameterization of a particular model was not broad enough. This means that the
experiment you did last week, or even the set of experiments you’ve been working
on over the past month, will probably need to be redone. If you have organized
and documented your work clearly, then repeating the experiment with the new
data or the new parameterization will be much, much easier.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Noble, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>156</sup></a></span></p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> How to organize project files<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-to-organize-project-files"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve explained <em>why</em> to organize project files, let’s talk about
<em>how</em> you can do that. We’ll cover higher-level principles in this
module. In the next few modules, we’ll move into more details and examples.</p>
<p>First, and at a minimum, you should get in the habit of storing all of the files
for an experiment in the same place. Specifically, project files should all be
in a single directory within the file system of a computer.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.; Buffalo, &lt;em&gt;Bioinformatics Data Skills&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>157</sup></a></span> While this can be an individual’s computer, it may
also be on a dedicated server or through an online, cloud-based program.</p>
<p>There are a number of advantages to keeping all of a project’s files inside a
dedicated file directory. First, it provides a clear and obvious place to search
for all project files as you work on the project, including after lulls (like
waiting for reviews from a paper submission).</p>
<p>One article about the reproducibility of scientific papers talks about how helpful
this organization can be, describing the experience for a project that involved
a large research group:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Instead of squirrelling away data in individual folders and lab books,
researchers now archive all published data in a designated central drive, so
that the information is accessible for the long haul. Initially, people thought
the process was just extra bureaucratic work, or that it had been invented so I
could police their data. Now, it has become the norm, and researchers tell me
they save time and worry by having their data organized and archived.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Catherine Winchester, &lt;span&gt;“Give Every Paper a Read for Reproducibility,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; 557, no. 7706 (2018): 281–82.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>158</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By keeping all project files within a single directory, you also make it
easier to share those files as a unit. There are several reasons you might
want to share these files. An obvious one is that you to share
the project files across members in your research team, so they can collaborate
on the project. However, there are also other reasons you’d need to
share files, and one that is growing in importance is that you may be asked to
share files (data, code scripts, etc.) when you publish a paper describing your
results.</p>
<p>When files are all stored in one directory, the directory can be compressed and
shared as an email attachment (if the file size is small enough) or through a
file sharing platform like Google Drive. When all the materials for a project
are stored in a single directory, it also makes it easier to share the set of
files through version control and online version control platforms.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Matti Vuorre and Matthew JC Crump, &lt;span&gt;“Sharing and Organizing Research Products as r Packages,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Behavior Research Methods&lt;/em&gt; 53 (2021): 792–802.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>159</sup></a></span> In later modules in this book (modules <a href="module9.html#module9">9</a>–<a href="module11.html#module11">11</a>), we will
introduce Git version control software and the GitHub platform for sharing files
under this type of version control—this is one example of this more dynamic
way of sharing files, but requires them to be stored in a single directory.</p>
<p>To gain the advantages of directory-based project file organization, all the
files need to be within a single directory, but they don’t all have to be within
the same “level” in that directory. Instead, you can use subdirectories to
structure and organize these files, while still retaining all the advantages of
directory-based file organization. Computer file systems are well-structured to
use a hierarchical design, with subdirectories nested inside directories. You
can leverage this structure to manage the complexity and breadth of files for your
project.</p>
<p>This will help limit the number of files in each “level” of the directory, so
none becomes an overwhelming collection of files of different types. It can help
you navigate the files in the directory, and also help someone else quickly
figure out what’s in the directory and where everything is. However,
to leverage these gains, you need to be thoughtful about exactly how you
organize the files into subdirectories.</p>
<p>As you decide how to organize files, keep in mind a concept called
<em>discoverability</em>. In the classic design book <em>The Design of Everyday
Things</em>, Don Norman presents discoverability as a key principle of good design,
explaining it as the ability for a user to be able to figure out, from the design
of something, how to use that thing quickly, easily, and correctly.</p>
<p>He illustrates this with an example of discoverability in the design of doors.
For a door, the location of a pull handle and a push bar immediately shows
someone how to use the door: pull on the side of the door where you see a pull
handle and push where you see a push bar. If the door is lacking these, it makes
it harder for a user to “discover” how to use it at first glance, and they might
try to push when they need to pull or vice-versa.</p>
<p>The same idea applies when you design an organizational system for project
files. You want to make sure that a new user (or you in the future) will be able
to easily navigate through the directory to find what they need. One article on
organizing research project files notes that, when it comes to deciding how to
organize your files, “The core guiding principle is simple: Someone unfamiliar
with your project should be able to look at your computer files and understand
in detail what you did and why.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Noble, &lt;span&gt;“A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>160</sup></a></span> Another notes, “The key
principle is to organize the [project directory] so that another person can know
what to expect from the plain meaning of the file and directory names.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen, &lt;span&gt;“Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using &lt;span&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; (and Friends).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>161</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Another way to improve discoverability is to name your files and subdirectories
in meaningful ways. The computer will give you wide flexibility in setting
names for files and subdirectories, but a human will find it much easier to
navigate a directory when the names are clear labels that describe the contents.
For example, if you have data from different assays, you might organize them
all into a directory named “raw_data” that is then divided into subdirectories
named with the type of assay.</p>
<p>As you develop names that are discoverable, keep in mind that your users may
include some people outside your field, for whom some shorthand common in the
field might be unclear. For example, in some studies of infectious bacterial
disease, the bacterial load is measured in an assay that counts colony forming
units. Among bench scientists in this field, the assay is often called “CFUs”.
If you are collaborating with a statistician, however, they may find the
files more discoverable if you named the subdirectory with these files something
like “bacterial_load” rather than “cfus”, as they may not be familiar with that
shorthand.</p>
<p>One way to improve discoverability is to follow any standards that exist for
organizing project files.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>162</sup></a></span> The use of standards or
conventions tend to make it easier for users to navigate (“discover”) new
instances of a certain type of thing. In module <a href="module2.html#module2">2</a>, we discussed this role of
standards when it comes to the format you use to record your data. When it comes
to project file organization, standards will come in the form of the
subdirectories that are included, how they’re organized hierarchically, and how
subdirectories and files are named.</p>
<p>These standards could exist as several levels: at a top level for your
discipline, but also just for your lab group, or even for you as an individual.
It is very helpful when standards exist at a discipline-wide level, as following
this type of high-level standard will immediately make your work discoverable
(in the design sense) to a wide group of people. As one article notes,
“Using widely held conventions… will help other people to understand how your
files relate to each other without having to ask you.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ibid.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>163</sup></a></span></p>
<p>As an example of this, when people develop R packages, the package consists of a
set of files, and there is a very clear and highly enforced standard for how
these files are arranged in a directory and how the subdirectories are named. By
enforcing this standard, many different people can create packages and have them
work in a similar way.</p>
<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, if there are not clear
standards at the level of your discipline, you could create a clear standard
that you plan to follow either for your lab group or even for your individual
work. If you’re consistent in organizing your files using that standard, it will
make it easier to navigate files as you move from one project to another.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, subdirectory organization can also be used in clever ways
within code scripts applied to files in the directory. For example, there are
functions in all scripting languages that will list all the files in a specified
subdirectory. If you keep all your raw data files of a certain type (for
example, all output from flow cytometry for the project) within a single
subdirectory, you can use this type of function with code scripts to list all
the files in that directory and then apply code that you’ve developed to
preprocess or visualize the data across all those files. This code would
continue to work as you added files to that directory, since it starts by
looking in that subdirectory each time it runs and working with all files there
as of that moment.</p>
<p>This type of automation can be a huge efficiency boost for your project.
One article describes how this type of automation can increase efficiency
with a comparison to a simpler task in working with computer files:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Organizing data files into a single directory with consistent filenames
prepares us to iterate over <em>all</em> of our data, whether it’s the four example
files used in this example, or 40,000 files in a real project. Think of it this
way: remember when you discovered you could select many files with your mouse
cursor? With this trick, you could move 60 files as easily as six files. You
could also select certain file types (e.g., photos) and attach them all to an
email with one movement. By using consistent file naming and directory
organization, you can do the same programatically using the Unix shell and other
programming languages.”<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Buffalo, &lt;em&gt;Bioinformatics Data Skills&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>164</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A final way to improve your directory organization is to make sure the directory
is not cluttered with unnecessary files. Unnecessary files can include old versions
of project files, which have been superseded by newer versions. In later modules
(modules <a href="module9.html#module9">9</a>–<a href="module11.html#module11">11</a>), we’ll describe how version control can help avoid this clutter
from old versions of files while retaining information from older versions as
files evolve.</p>

<p>Louis Pastuer famously said that “Luck favors the prepared mind.” In file
organization, as with so much else, time spent preparing can pay off
exponentially later. In this case, the next step is to not only use a structured
directory for each project or experiment, but to start using the same,
standardized structure for every one of your projects and experiments—in other
words, to create a standard for file organziation and to use it consistently.</p>
<p>In other modules, we talk about how templates can be used to improve the rigor
and reproducibility of collecting and reporting on data. Just as it’s possible
to create templates for data collection and for reports, it’s also possible to
create a template for how you organize file directories for your scientific
projects, creating and applying standards for things like which subdirectories
are included and how files are named. This takes more work—to design a
structure that can be used across many projects, rather than to set something
up <em>ad hoc</em> as you start each new experiment. However, the gains in terms of
organization and efficiency can be extraordinary.</p>
<p>This involves first designing a common template for the directory structure for
your projects. Once you have decided on a structure for this template, you can
create a version of it on your computer—a file directory with all the
subdirectories included, but without any files (or only template files you’d
want to use as a starting point in each project, like templates for data
collection and reports as presented in modules <a href="module4.html#module4">4</a> and <a href="module5.html#module5">5</a>). When you start a
new project, you can then just copy this template directory, rename it, and
start using it for your new research project. If you are using R and begin to
use R Projects (described in the next section), you can also create an R Studio
Project template to serve as this kind of starting point each time you start a
new project.</p>
<p>In other areas of science and engineering, this idea of standardized directory
structures has allowed the development of powerful techniques for open-source
software developers to work together. For example, anyone may create their own
extensions to the R programming language and share these with others through
GitHub or several large repositories. As mentioned earlier in this
module, this is coordinated by enforcing a common directory structure on these
extension “packages”—to create a new package, you must put certain types of
files in certain subdirectories within a project directory. With these
standardized rules of directory structure and content, each of these packages
can interact with the base version of R, since there are functions that can tap
into any of these new packages by assuming where each type of file will be
within the package’s directory of files.</p>
<p>In a similar way, if you impose a common directory structure across all the
project directories in your research lab, your collaborators will quickly be
able to learn where to find each element, even in projects they are new to, and
you will all be able to write code that can be easily applied across all project
directories, allowing you to improve reproducibility and comparability across
all projects by assuring that you are conducting the same pre-processing and
analysis across all projects (or, if you are conducting things differently for
different projects, that you are deliberate and aware that you are doing so).
Creating a project template that you copy and rename as you start a new
project is one way to facilitate this.</p>
<p>As you use a template for a project, you can customize it as you need. For
example, if you had included a subdirectory for flow cytometry data, but are not
running that assay in this experiment, you can remove that subdirectory.
Similarly, you can customize the report as you go to help it work well for this
specific experiment. However, you will aim to keep to the standard format as
much as possible, since it’s the standardization across projects that provides
many of the advantages.</p>
<p>In module <a href="module7.html#module7">7</a>, we will walk through the steps of designing a project
template that you can use across experiments for your laboratory group. In
module <a href="module8.html#module8">8</a>, we’ll walk through an example of creating and using this kind of
project template for an example set of studies.</p>
