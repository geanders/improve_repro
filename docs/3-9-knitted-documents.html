<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> Knitted documents</h2>
<p>If you have coded using a scripting language like R or Python, you likely have
already seen many examples of knitted documents. For both these languages, there
are many tutorials available that are created as knitted documents. Figure
@ref{fig:xcmsexample} shows an example from the start of a vignette for the
<code>xcms</code> package in R. This is a package that helps with pre-processing and
analyzing data from LC-MS experiments. You can see that this document includes
text to explain the package and also example code and the output from that code.</p>

<p>In this module we will describe the characteristics of knitted documents and how
the technology behind them works. We will then talk about how you can create
them specifically using R markdown.</p>
<p>The defining characteristic of a knitted document is that it interweaves two
elements: first, executable code, and, second, formatted documentation that is
meant for humans to read. In the figure with the example from the <code>xcms</code>
vignette, we have highlighted the areas that demonstrate these two pieces
(Figure [x]). Later in this module we will describe how a knitted document can
incorporate these two elements. First we want to highlight why you might want to
use knitted documents to document your own research code, especially for
pre-processing protocols.</p>
<p>There are several advantages to using knitted documents when writing code to pre-process or analyze research data. First when you have written your code inside a knitted document the code itself is checked every time you render the document. In other words you are checking your code to ensure it operates as you like as you build your document. This helps to increase the reliability of the code that you have written, especially as you work to reapply it to new data set. As you work with open source code, you will find that the packages can change some overtime, as the developers continue to develop them. By including code that is checked each time of document is rendered, you can quickly identify when a change an open source software effects the analysis that you were conducting or the pre-processing and work 2 adapt to any changes quickly.</p>
<p>Second, when you write a pre-processing protocol or other document that includes executable code allows you to easily rerun the code as you update the data set or adopt the code to work with a new data set. Another approach would be to run all your code and copy the results into a document in a word processing program like word or Google Docs. If you did that, you would need to recopy all results every time you shipped the code or add new data. By contrast, when you are working with a knitted document the rendering process don’t executes the code and incorporates the results into a nicely formatted final document. The use of knitted documents therefore can substantially improve the efficiency of pre-processing and analyzing your data and generating the reports that summarize this process.</p>
<p>3rd documents that are created in knitted format are created using plain text. Plain text files can easily be tracked well and clearly using Version Control tools like git. This substantially increases the transparency of the process. It allows you to clearly document changes you make in the document, step by step. You can document who made the change, and that person can include a message about why they made the change. The full history of changes is documented and can be searched to explore how the document evolved and why.</p>
<p>The final advantage of using knitted documents, especially for pre-process research data, is that it allows the code to be clearly and thoroughly documented. This can help increase the reproducibility of the process. In other words it can help ensure that another researcher could repeat the process that you did, making adaptations as appropriate for different data sets. It also means that you can remember exactly what you did and reuse are adopt the code as you work with other data sets. An alternative way of creating code to pre-process data would be through a code script. A code script does allow you to include documentation about the code through code comments. However these are much less expressive and harder to read the nicely formatted text. A knitted document allows you to write the documentation in a format that is clear and attractive for humans to read, well including code that is clear an easy for a computer to execute.</p>
<p>Next We will describe how needed documents work. there are seven components for how did it documents work. We have listed them here and in the following paragraphs will describe each more fully:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Knitted documents start as plain text</li>
<li>A special section at the start of the document (<strong>preamble</strong>) gives some
overall directions about the document</li>
<li>Special combinations of characters indicate where the executable code starts</li>
<li>Other special combinations show where the regular text starts (and the
executable code section ends)</li>
<li>Formatting for the rest of the document is specified with a <strong>markup language</strong></li>
<li>You create the final document by <strong>rendering</strong> the plain text document. This
process runs through two software programs.</li>
<li>The final document is attractive and <strong>read-only</strong>—you should never make
edits to this output, only to your initial plain text document.</li>
</ol>
<p>First a knitted document starts as plain text. When you write in a document in other words you were writing it in plain text. Here is an example of what the plan text might look like for the start of the xcms tutorial shown in an earlier figure:
[Example of that]
There are a few things that you should keep in mind when you were writing plain text. First you should always use a text editor rather than a word processor when you were writing a document in plain text. Text editors can include things like notepad, textedit, Nano. you can also use a more advanced text editor like VI them or Emax. rstudio can also serve as a text editor, and if you were doing other work in rstudio this might be the most obvious option to use to write knitted documents. The reason to use a text editor rather than a word processor is the same as why you must use a text editor to write code Scripts. Word processors often include formatting but is saved through underlying code rather than clearly evident on the initial document. They also automatically convert some symbols into slightly fancier versions, which can cause issues in either the code or in the formatting specifications that you give for the text documenting the code.<br />
Another thing to consider when you are writing plain text is it typically you should only use characters from the American Standard code for information interchange or ASCII. this is a fairly simple character set that includes 128 characters it mostly includes what you can clearly see on your keyboard including the digit 0 to 9 lowercase and uppercase alphabet some symbols like punctuation symbols the! Quotation marks some mathematical symbols like plus minus division some control codes like a new line a tab even ringing a bell. The full set of characters included in a ski can be found in a number of sources including a very thorough Wikipedia page on this character set. Because the character set available for plain text files is so small, you will find that it becomes important to leverage those characters that are available. One example is with white space. white space is an important component that can be used to make plain text files clear for humans to read. As we begin discussing the convention for markdown languages, we will find that white space is often used to help specify formatting as well.
The Second component of a knitted document is that it will have a special section at the start of the document called The Preamble. This Preamble will give some overall directions about the document. There are a number of different markup languages including HTML, latek, and Markdown. In Rmarkdown, we will be focusing on Markdown. In markdown, the Preamble is specified using something called YAML. This is short for YAML Ain’t markup language. for example here is the YAML for a sample report on pre-processing data:
[Include sample YAML]
In this Preamble using YAML you can specify things using keys and valleys. For example you specify the title by including the key value of title in the YAML, a colon, a space, and then the value you would like to use for the title which in this case is [example title]. as another example this year, specify the type of output for the document using the output key a colon and then the choice of pdf_document. the rules for which keys can be included in the Preamble will depend on the type of markup language. Here we are using examples in markdown but you can also use other markup languages likely attack an HTML, and these will have their own convention for specifying the preamble. When we talk more specifically about rmarkdown we will give some resources where you can find more about how you can customize the Preamble in R markdown specifically. If you are using a different R markdown language there are numerous websites cheat sheets and other resources you can use to find out the keywords that are available for the Preamble and the type of document you’re creating, as well as the possible choices for those keywords in terms of the values that they can take.</p>
<p>The Next characteristic of knitted documents is that they need to clearly demarcate where executable code starts and wear regular formatted text start in other words where the executable code section is. To Jesus, knitted documents will have a special combination of characters in the plain text that can be used to indicate where executable code starts. They will have a different set of combinations that show where the regular text starts and so we’re executable code sections it. For example here is a set of plain text that could be used in an R markdown document to specify some texts that will be formatted then some executable code and then the start of more regular text:
[Example RMarkdown code]
the combination that indicates the start of executable code will vary based on the language being used in the type of knitted document that you were building in R markdown the following combination indicates the start of executable code:</p>
<p><code>```{r}</code></p>
<p>Conversely, this combination indicates the end of executable code in other words the start of regular text:</p>
<p><code>```</code></p>
<p>Above, we have shown the most basic version of the markup used to specify the start of executable code. This can be expanded however to include some specifications for how you want the code in the following section to be run and how you want output to be shown. For example you could use the following indications to specify that the code should be run but should not be printed by specifying Echo equals false and that the created figure should be centered on the Page by using fig.align equals Center:</p>
<p><code>```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}</code></p>
<p>There are numerous options that can be used to specify how the code will be run, and later when we talk specifically about rmarkdown we will Point toward some resources that clarify and outline all the possible choices that can be used for these specifications.
You may have noticed that these seem like very odd character combination. There is a good reason for this. we want the knitted document to specify the start and end of sections of executable code by using a character combination that is very unlikely to come up in the regular text that we are typing. This way there will be very few cases where we unintentionally indicate the start of a new section of executable code.
The next characteristic of knitted documents is that formatting for the rest of the document, other than executable code, is specified using what is called a markup language. When you were writing in plain text, you do not have buttons to click on for formatting like bold, italic, font size, and so on. Instead you use special characters or character combinations to specify formatting in the final document. For example in marked down, you’ll see around a word or phrase into asterisks to make it bold. TTo write “<strong>this</strong>” in the final document, you’ll write <code>"**this**"</code> in the
plain text initial document.
Here is an example based on the xcms vignette highlighted in an earlier figure. The start of the texts shown in Figure 1 is written like that:
[Example Markdown]
you might notice that in this text things like the section header, which is quotation initial data inspection quotation, is marked with a hash to indicate that it is a section header. Other formatting like the use of a computer code style font to indicate code is marked by surrounding that word in backticks. the process of writing your document in this way can feel a little like the old fashion style of dictating to a secretary. You can imagine yourself dictate to the computer through the plain text. You have to say not just the words, but you have to specify in that same format in the plain text the formatting that you want at each spot. For example when you get to a word that you want in italics, you essentially need to tell the computer start italics, then say the word, then say to end the italics. You do this using the special formatting characters that are specified by the markup language that you use. Later in this module we will point to resources for discovering all of these formatting specifications for Markdown, which is again the markup language used by RMarkdown.
The final characteristics of knitted documents is that to create the final document you will render the plain text document and that this will create an attractive document that is read-only. When you render the document it will be run through to software program the first will look only four sections with executable code. It will execute that code and take any output, including numeric results, other data results, figures, and tables, and insert those at the relevant spot in the document. Next these output files will be run through another software program that will look for all the formatting instruction and render the final document in an attractive format for humans to read. this output can be in a number of file format, depending on your specifications, including a PDF document, an HTML file, or a Word document. You should consider the final document, regardless of the output format, as read-only. This means that you should never make edits or changes to the final version of the document. Instead you should make any changes to your initial plain text file. this is because the rendering process will overwrite any previous versions of the final document. Therefore any changes that you have made to your final document will be overwritten anytime you re-render from the initial plain text document.</p>
