<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> The ‘tidy’ data format</h2>
<p>The “tidy” data format is an implementation of a structured data format popular
among statisticians and data scientists. By consistently using this data format,
researchers can combine simple, generalizable tools to perform complex tasks in
data processing, analysis, and visualization. We will explain what
characteristics determine if a dataset is “tidy” and how use of the “tidy”
implementation of a structure data format can improve the ease and efficiency of
“Team Science”.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.</strong> After this module, the trainee will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List characteristics defining the “tidy” structured data format</li>
<li>Explain the difference between the a structured data format (general concept)
and the ‘tidy’ data format (one popular implementation)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the previous module, we explained the benefits of saving data in a structured
format, and in particular using a two-dimensional format saved to a plain text
file when possible. In this section, we’ll talk about the “tidy text” format—a
set of principles to use when structuring two-dimensional tabular data. These
principles cover some basic rules for ordering the data, and the resulting datasets
can be very easily worked with, including to clean, model, and visualize the
data, using a series of open-source tools on the R platform called the “tidyverse”.
These characteristics mean that, if you are planning to use a standardized data
format for recording experimental data in your research group, you may want to
consider creating on that adheres to the “tidy data” rules.</p>
<p>To explain more simply, it is usually very little work to record data in a structure
that follows the “tidy data” principles, especially if you are planning to record
the data in a two-dimensional, tabular format already, and following these
principles can bring some big advantages. We explain these rules and provide
examples of biomedical datasets that both comply and don’t comply with these
principles, to help make it clearer how you could structure a “tidy-compliant”
structure for recording experimental data for your own research.</p>
<p>Since a key advantage of the “tidy data” format is that it works so well with
R’s “tidyverse” tools, we’ll also talk a bit in this section about the use of
scripting languages like R, and how using them to analyze and visualize the
data you collect can improve the overall reproducibility of your research.</p>
<p>The principles of “tidy data” were explained in a paper in [x] by [x]. The word
“tidy” was used because … . It is not meant to apply that other formats are
“dirty”, or that they include data that is incorrect or subpar. In fact, the
same set of datapoints could be saved in a file in a way that is either “tidy”
(in the sense of [paper] or untidy, depending only on how the data are organized
across columns and rows.</p>
<p>If the data is the same regardless of whether it’s “tidy” or not, then why all
the fuss about following the “tidy” principles when you’re designing the format
you’ll use to record your data? The magic here in this—if you follow these
principles, then your data can be immediately input into a collection of powerful
tools for visualizing and analyzing the data, without further cleaning steps.
What’s more, all those tools (the set of tools is calld the “tidyverse”) will
typically <em>output</em> your data in a “tidy” format, as well.</p>
<p>Once you have tools that input and output data in the same way, it becomes very
easy to model each of the tools as “small, sharp tools”—each one does one
thing, and does it really well. That’s because, if each tool needs the same
type of input and creates that same type of output, those tools can be chained
together to solve complex problems. The alternative is to create large software
tools, ones that do a lot to the input data before giving you some output.
“Big” tools are harder to understand, and more importantly, they make it hard
to adapt your own solutions, and to go beyond the analysis or visualization that
the original tool creators were thinking of when they created it. Think of it this
way—if you were writing an essay, how much more can you say when you can mix and
match words to create your own sentences versus if you were made to combine
pre-set sentences?</p>
<p>These small tools can be combined together because they take the same input
(data in a “tidy” format) and they output in the same format (also data in a
“tidy” format). This is such a powerful idea that many of the best loved toys
work on the same principle. Think of interlocking plastic block sets, like Lego.
You can create almost anything with a large enough set of Legos, because they
can be combined in almost any kind of way. Why? Because they all follow a
standard size for the … on top of each block, and they all “input” … of that
same size on the bottom of the block. That means they can be joined together in
any order and combination, and as a result very complex structures can be
created. It also means that each piece can be small and easy to understand—if
you’re building a Lego structure, even something very fancy, you’ll probably use
lots of rectangular brinks that are two … across and four … long, and that’s
easy enough to describe that you could probably get a young child to help you
find those pieces when you need them.</p>
<p>We’ll next describe what rules a dataset’s format must follow for it to be
“tidy”, and try to clarify how you can set up your data recording to follow
these rules. In a later part of this module, we’ll talk more about the tidyverse
tools that you can use with this data, as well as give some resources for
finding out more about the tidyverse and how to use its tools.</p>
<p>First, to be “tidy”, a dataset must be tabular and two-dimensional, a structured
data format described in the previous module. It should not be saved in a
hierarchical structure, like XML (although there are now tools for converting
data from XML to a “tidy” format, so you may still be able to take advantage of
the tidyverse even if you must use XML for your data recording).</p>

depths. Transparency is a passive quality. A program is passive when it is possible
to form a simple mental model of its behavior that is actuaally predictive for all

<p>“Software systems are discoverable when they include features that are designed
to help you build in your mind a correct mental model of what they do and how they
work. So, for example, good documentation helps discoverability to a programmer. Discoverability
is an active quality. To achieve it in your software, you cannot merely fail to be obscure,
you have to go out of your way to be helpful.” <span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Elegant code does much with little. Elegant code is not only correct but visibly,
<em>transparently</em> correct. It does not merely communicate an algorithm to a computer,
but also conveys insight and assurance to the mind of a human that reads it. By seeking
elegance in our code, we build better code. Learning to write transparent code is a first,
long step toward learning how to write elegant code—and taking care to make code
discoverable helps us learn how to make it transparent. Elegant code is both transparent and
discoverable.” <span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“To design for transparency and discoverability, you need to apply every tactic for
keeping your code simple, and also concentrate on the ways in which your code is a
communication to other human beings. The first questions to ask, after ‘Will this design
work?’ are ‘Will it be reaadable to other people? Is it elegant?’ We hope it is clear …
that these questions are not fluff and that elegance is not a luxury. These qualities
in the human reaction to software are essential for reducing its bugginess and
increasing its long-term maintainability.” <span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Unix style of design applies the do-one-thing-well approach at the level of
cooperating programs as well as cooperating routines within a program,
emphasizing small programs connected by well-defined interprocess communication
or by shared files. Accordingly, the Unix operating system encourages us to break our
programs down into simple subprocesses, and to concentrate on the interfaces between
these subprocesses.” <span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The ability to combine programs [with piping] can be extremely useful. But the real
win here is not cute combinations; it’s that because both pipes and <em>more(1)</em> exist,
<em>other programs can be simpler</em>. Pipes mean that programs like <em>ls(1)</em> (and other
programs that write to standard out) don’t have to grow their own pagers—and we’re
saved from a word of a thousand built-in pagers (each, naturally, with its own divergent
look and feel). Code bloat is avoided and global complexity reduced. As a bonus, if
anyone needs to customize pager behavior, it can be done in <em>one</em> place, by changing
<em>one</em> program. Indeed, multiple pagers can exist, and will all be useful with every application
that writes to standard output.” <span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Unix was born in 1969 and has been in continuous production use ever since. That’s several
geological eras by computer industry standards. … Unix’s durability and adaptability have
been nothing short of astonishing. Other technologies have come and gone like mayflies.
Machines have increased a thousand-fold in power, languages have mutated, industry practice
has gone through multiple revolutions—and Unix hangs in there, still producing, still paying
the bills, and still commanding loyalty from many of the best and brightest software technologists
on the planet.” <span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“One of the many consequences of the exponential power-versus-time curve in computing, and the
corresponding pace of software development, is that 50% of what one knows becomes obsolete over
every 18 months. Unix does not abolish this phenomenon, but does do a good job of containing it.
There’s a bedrock of unchanging basics—languages, system calls, and tool invocations—that one
can actually keep for entire years, even decades. Elsewhere it is impossible to predict what will
be stable; even entire operating systems cycle out of use. Under Unix, there is a fairly sharp
distinction between transient knowledge and lasting knowledge, and one can know ahead of time
(with about 90% certainty) which category something is likely to fall in when one learns it. Thus
the loyalty Unix commands.” <span class="citation">(Raymond 2003)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Unix is famous for being designed around the philosophy of small, sharp tools, each
intended to do one thing well. This philosophy is enabled by using a common underlying
format—the line-oriented, plain text file. Databases used for system administration
(users and passwords, network configuration, and so on) are all kept as plain
text files. … When a system crashes, you may be faced with only a minimal
environment to restore it (you may not be able to access graphics drivers,
for instance). Situations such as this can really make you appreciate the simplicity of
plain text.” <span class="citation">(Hunt, Thomas, and Cunningham 2000)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Unix is the foundational computing environment in bioinformatics because its
design is the antithesis of [a] inflexible and fragile approach. The Unix shell
was designed to allow users to easily build complex programs by interfacing
smaller modular programs together. This approach is the Unix philosophy:
‘This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because
that is a universal interface.’–Doug McIlory”. <span class="citation">(Buffalo 2015)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Passing the output of one program directly into the input of another
program with pipes is a computationally efficient and simple way to interface
Unix programs. This is another reason why bioinformaticians (and software engineers
in general) like Unix. Pipes allow us to build larger, more complex tools from
modular parts. It doesn’t matter what language a program is written in, either; pipes
will work between anything as long as both programs understand the data passed
between them. As the lowest common denominator between most programs, plain-text
streams are often used—a point that McIlroy makes in his quote about the
Unix philosophy.” <span class="citation">(Buffalo 2015)</span></p>
