## Example: Creating a template for "tidy" data collection

We will walk through an example of creating a template to collect data in a
"tidy" format for a laboratory-based research project, based on a research
project on drug efficacy in murine tuberculosis models. We will show the initial
"untidy" format for data recording and show how we converted it to a "tidy"
format. Finally, we will show how the data can then easily be analyzed and
visualized using reproducible tools.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Understand how the principles of "tidy" data can be applied for a real, complex research project;
- List advantages of the "tidy" data format for the example project
