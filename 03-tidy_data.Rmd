## The 'tidy' data format

The "tidy" data format is an implementation of a structured data format popular
among statisticians and data scientists. By consistently using this data format,
researchers can combine simple, generalizable tools to perform complex tasks in
data processing, analysis, and visualization. We will explain what
characteristics determine if a dataset is "tidy" and how use of the "tidy"
implementation of a structure data format can improve the ease and efficiency of
"Team Science".

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- List characteristics defining the "tidy" structured data format 
- Explain the difference between the a structured data format (general concept)
and the 'tidy' data format (one popular implementation)
