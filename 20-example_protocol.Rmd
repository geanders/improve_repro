## Example: Creating a reproducible data pre-processing protocol

We will walk through an example of creating a reproducible protocol for the
automated gating of flow cytometry data for a project on the immunology of
tuberculosis lead by one of our Co-Is. This data pre-processing protocol was
created using RMarkdown and allows the efficient, transparent, and reproducible
gating of flow cytometry data for all experiments in the research group. We will
walk the trainees through how we developed the protocol initially, the final
pre-processing protocol, how we apply this protocol to new experimental data.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Explain how a reproducible data pre-processing protocol can be integrated into
a real research project
- Understand how to design and implement a data pre-processing protocol to
replace manual or point-and-click data pre-processing tools

### Subsection 1

[Separating pre-processing by data type / equipment output]

[Splitting pre-processing into "modules" of processes that need to happen---for
example, standardizing across samples, transforming data to satisfy distribution
requirements for statistical models / tests, removing extraneous data (dead
cells in flow cytometry, for example), ...]

[For each module, consider the options you could take in pre-processing. For
open-source software, like Bioconductor packages, these options are likely
embedded either in your choice of functions (across a package), or even choice
of packages in some cases, and then at a finer level through the parameters in a
package. You can use vigettes and package manuals to identify the different
functions you can choose and then use the helpfile for a function to determine
all of its parameters and the choices you can select for each. In the protocol,
show the code that you use to implement this choice and also explain clearly in
the text why you made this choice and what alternatives should be considered if
data characteristics are different. Write this as if you are explaining to a new
research group member (or your future self) how to think about this step in the
pre-processing, why you're doing it the way your doing it, and what code is used
to do it that way. You should also include references that justify choices when
they are available---include these using BibTex. By doing this, you will make it
much easier on yourself when you write the Methods section of papers that report
on the data you have pre-processed, as you'll already have draft information on
your pre-processing methods in your protocol.]

[Throughout, use an example dataset, preferably from your own research lab. You
likely want to select one for project that you have already published or are
getting ready to publish, so you won't feel awkard about making the data
available for people to practice with. You can include the data and the
RMarkdown in its own RStudio Project and post this either publicly or privately
on GitHub. This creates a "packet" of everything that a reader needs to use to
recreate what you did---they can download the whole GitHub repository and will
have a nice project directory on their computer with everything they need to try
out the protocol. If you don't have an example dataset from your own laboratory,
you can explore example datasets that are already available, either as data
included with existing R packages or through open repositories, included those
hosted through national research institutions like the NIH. In this case, be
sure to cite the source of the data and include any available information about
the equipment that was used to collect it and the settings used when the data
were collected.]
