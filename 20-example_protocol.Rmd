## Example: Creating a reproducible data pre-processing protocol

We will walk through an example of creating a reproducible protocol for the
automated gating of flow cytometry data for a project on the immunology of
tuberculosis lead by one of our Co-Is. This data pre-processing protocol was
created using RMarkdown and allows the efficient, transparent, and reproducible
gating of flow cytometry data for all experiments in the research group. We will
walk the trainees through how we developed the protocol initially, the final
pre-processing protocol, how we apply this protocol to new experimental data.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Explain how a reproducible data pre-processing protocol can be integrated into
a real research project
- Understand how to design and implement a data pre-processing protocol to
replace manual or point-and-click data pre-processing tools
