#  Experimental Data Preprocessing

## Principles and benefits of scripted pre-processing of experimental data

The experimental data collected for biomedical research often requires
pre-processing before it can be analyzed (e.g., gating of flow cytometry data,
feature finding / quantification for mass spectrometry data). Use of
point-and-click software can limit the transparency and reproducibility of this
analysis stage and is time-consuming for repeated tasks. We will explain how
scripted pre-processing, especially using open source software, can improve
transparency and reproducibility.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Define 'pre-processing' of experimental data 
- Describe an open source code script and explain how it can increase
reproducibility of data pre-processing
