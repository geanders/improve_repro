#  Experimental Data Preprocessing

## Principles and benefits of scripted pre-processing of experimental data

The experimental data collected for biomedical research often requires
pre-processing before it can be analyzed (e.g., gating of flow cytometry data,
feature finding / quantification for mass spectrometry data). Use of
point-and-click software can limit the transparency and reproducibility of this
analysis stage and is time-consuming for repeated tasks. We will explain how
scripted pre-processing, especially using open source software, can improve
transparency and reproducibility.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Define 'pre-processing' of experimental data 
- Describe an open source code script and explain how it can increase
reproducibility of data pre-processing

### Subsection 1

For bioinformatics, "all too often the software is developed without
thought toward future interoperability with other software products. As a 
result, the bioinformatics software landscape is currently characterized
by fragmentation and silos, in which each research group develops and uses
only the tools created within their lab." [@barga2011bioinformatics]

"The group also noted the lack of agility. Although they may be aware of
a new or better algorithm they cannot easily integrate it into their 
analysis pipelines given the lack of standards across both data formats
and tools. It typically requires a complete rewrite of the code in order
to take advntge of a new technique or algorithm, requiring time and often
funding to hire developers." [@barga2011bioinformatics]
