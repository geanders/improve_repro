## Designing templates for "tidy" data collection

This module will move from the principles of the "tidy" data format to the
practical details of designing a "tidy" data format to use when collecting
experimental data. We will describe common issues that prevent biomedical
research datasets from being "tidy" and show how these issues can be avoided. We
will also provide rubrics and a checklist to help determine if a data collection
template complies with a "tidy" format.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Identify characteristics that keep a dataset from being 'tidy'
- Convert data from an "untidy" to a "tidy" format
