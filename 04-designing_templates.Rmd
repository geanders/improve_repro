## Designing templates for "tidy" data collection

This module will move from the principles of the "tidy" data format to the
practical details of designing a "tidy" data format to use when collecting
experimental data. We will describe common issues that prevent biomedical
research datasets from being "tidy" and show how these issues can be avoided. We
will also provide rubrics and a checklist to help determine if a data collection
template complies with a "tidy" format.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Identify characteristics that keep a dataset from being 'tidy'
- Convert data from an "untidy" to a "tidy" format 

### Subsection 1

> "Or maybe your goal is that your data is *usable* in a wide range of
applications? If so, consider adopting standard formats and metadata 
standards early on. At the very least, keep track of versions of data
and code, with associated dates." [@goodman2014ten]

> "Standards for data include, for example, data formats, data exchange
protocols, and meta-data controlled vocabularies." [@barga2011bioinformatics]

> "Software systems are transparent when they don't have murky corners or hidden
depths. Transparency is a passive quality. A program is passive when it is possible
to form a simple mental model of its behavior that is actuaally predictive for all
or most cases, because you can see through the machinery to what is actually going 
on." [@raymond2003art]

> "Software systems are discoverable when they include features that are designed 
to help you build in your mind a correct mental model of what they do and how they
work. So, for example, good documentation helps discoverability to a programmer. Discoverability
is an active quality. To achieve it in your software, you cannot merely fail to be obscure, 
you have to go out of your way to be helpful." [@raymond2003art]

> "Elegant code does much with little. Elegant code is not only correct but visibly, 
*transparently* correct. It does not merely communicate an algorithm to a computer, 
but also conveys insight and assurance to the mind of a human that reads it. By seeking
elegance in our code, we build better code. Learning to write transparent code is a first, 
long step toward learning how to write elegant code---and taking care to make code 
discoverable helps us learn how to make it transparent. Elegant code is both transparent and
discoverable." [@raymond2003art]

> "To design for transparency and discoverability, you need to apply every tactic for
keeping your code simple, and also concentrate on the ways in which your code is a 
communication to other human beings. The first questions to ask, after 'Will this design
work?' are 'Will it be reaadable to other people? Is it elegant?' We hope it is clear ...
that these questions are not fluff and that elegance is not a luxury. These qualities
in the human reaction to software are essential for reducing its bugginess and
increasing its long-term maintainability." [@raymond2003art]

> "Software is maintainable to the extent that people who are not its author can 
successfully understand and modify it. Maintainability demands more than code that
works; it demands code that follows the Rule of Clarity and communicates successfully 
to human beings as well as the computer." [@raymond2003art]
