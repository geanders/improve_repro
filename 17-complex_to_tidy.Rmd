## Example: Converting from complex to 'tidy' data formats

 We will provide a detailed example of a case where data pre-processing in R
 results in a complex, 'untidy' data format. We will walk through an example of
 applying automated gating to flow cytometry data. We will demonstrate the
 complex initial format of this pre-processed data and then show trainees how a
 'tidy' dataset can be extracted and used for further data analysis and
 visualization using the popular R 'tidyverse' tools. This example will use real
 experimental data from one of our Co-Is research on the immunology of
 tuberculosis.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Describe how tools like \textit{biobroom} were used in this real research
example to convert from the complex data format from pre-processing to a format
better for further data analysis and visualization
- Understand how these tools would fit in their own research pipelines
