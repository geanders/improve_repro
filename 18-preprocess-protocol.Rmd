## Introduction to reproducible data pre-processing protocols

Reproducibility tools can be used to create reproducible data pre-processing
protocols---documents that combine code and text in a 'knitted' document, which
can be re-used to ensure data pre-processing is consistent and reproducible
across research projects. In this module, we will describe how reproducible data
pre-processing protocols can improve reproducibility of pre-processing
experimental data, as well as to ensure transparency, consistency, and
reproducibility across the research projects conducted by a research team.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Define a 'reproducible data pre-processing protocol' 
- Explain how such protocols improve reproducibility at the data pre-processing
phase
- List other benefits, including improving efficiency and consistency of data
pre-processing

speaking punctuation and formatting, like new paragraphs or bold.]

[Anecdote---any stories of famous authors trying to retrieve old manuscripts in 
outdated file formats?]

[Example of old, plain text emails and the beginnings of Markdown-style notation
there? More on history of Markdown and other markup languages? (Readers minds were the
first renders for this ancestor of Markdown, but now there are software programs
that render the plain-text file into other formats, like Word, PDF, or HTML.)]

### Subsection 2

> "It's very important to keep a project notebook containing detailed information
about the chronology of your computational work, steps you've taken, information 
about why you've made decisions, and of course all pertinent information to 
reproduce your work. Some scientists do this in a handwritten notebook, others in
Microsoft Word documents. As with README files, bioinformaticians usually like keeping
project notebooks in simple plain-text because these can be read, searched, and 
edited from the command line and across network connections to servers. Plain text
is also a future-proof format: plain-text files written in the 1960s are still 
readable today, whereas files from word processors only 10 years old can be 
difficult or impossible to open and edit. Additionally, plain text project notebooks can 
also be put under version control ... While plain-text is easy to write in your 
text editor, it can be inconvenient for collaborators unfamiliar with the command 
line to read. A lightweight markup language called *Markdown* is a plain-text format
that is easy to read and painlessly incorporated into typed notes, and can also be 
rendered to HTML or PDF." [@buffalo2015bioinformatics]

> "Markdown originates from the simple formatting conventions used in plain-text 
emails. Long before HTML crept into email, emails were embellished with simple
markup for emphasis, lists, and blocks of text. Over time, this became a defacto
plain-text email formatting scheme. This scheme is very intuitive: underscores or 
asterisks that flank text indicate emphasis, and lists are simply lines of text 
beginning with dashes." [@buffalo2015bioinformatics]

> "Markdown is just plain-text, which means that it's portable and programs to edit
and read it will exist. Anyone who's written notes or papers in old versions of 
word processors is likely familiar with the hassle of trying to share or update
out-of-date proprietary formats. For these reasons, Markdown makes for a simple 
and elegant notebook format." [@buffalo2015bioinformatics]
