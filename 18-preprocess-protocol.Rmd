## Introduction to reproducible data pre-processing protocols

Reproducibility tools can be used to create reproducible data pre-processing
protocols---documents that combine code and text in a 'knitted' document, which
can be re-used to ensure data pre-processing is consistent and reproducible
across research projects. In this module, we will describe how reproducible data
pre-processing protocols can improve reproducibility of pre-processing
experimental data, as well as to ensure transparency, consistency, and
reproducibility across the research projects conducted by a research team.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Define a 'reproducible data pre-processing protocol' 
- Explain how such protocols improve reproducibility at the data pre-processing
phase
- List other benefits, including improving efficiency and consistency of data
pre-processing
