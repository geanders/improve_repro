## Power of using a single structured 'Project' directory for storing and tracking research project files

To improve the computational reproducibility of a research project, researchers
can use a single 'Project' directory to collectively store all research data,
meta-data, pre-processing code, and research products (e.g., paper drafts,
figures). We will explain how this practice improves the reproducibility and
list some of the common components and subdirectories to include in the
structure of a 'Project' directory, including subdirectories for raw and
pre-processed experimental data.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Describe a 'Project' directory, including common components and subdirectories 
- List how a single 'Project' directory improves reproducibility

### Subsection 1

One study surveyed over 250 biomedical researchers at the University of Washington. 
They noted that, "a common theme surrounding data management and analysis was that 
may researchers preferred to utilize their own individual methods to organize data.
The varied ways of managing data were accepted as functional for most present needs.
Some researchers admitted to having no organizational methodology at all, while others
used whatever method best suited their individual needs." [@anderson2007issues]
One respondent answered, "They're not organized in any way---they're just thrown into
files under different projects," while another said "I grab them when I need them, they're
not organized in any decent way," and another, "It's not even organized---a file on a central
computer of protocols that we use, common lab protocols but those are just individual 
Word files within a folder so it's not searchable per se." [@anderson2007issues]

"In general, data reuse is most possible when: 1) data; 2) metadata (information
describing the data); and 3) information about the process of generating those data, 
such as code, are all provided." [@goodman2014ten]
