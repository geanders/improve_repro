## Power of using a single structured 'Project' directory for storing and tracking research project files

To improve the computational reproducibility of a research project, researchers
can use a single 'Project' directory to collectively store all research data,
meta-data, pre-processing code, and research products (e.g., paper drafts,
figures). We will explain how this practice improves the reproducibility and
list some of the common components and subdirectories to include in the
structure of a 'Project' directory, including subdirectories for raw and
pre-processed experimental data.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Describe a 'Project' directory, including common components and subdirectories 
- List how a single 'Project' directory improves reproducibility
