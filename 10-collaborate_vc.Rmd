## Enhance the reproducibility of collaborative research with version control platforms

Once a researcher has learned to use *git* on their own computer for
local version control, they can begin using version control platforms (e.g.,
*GitLab*, *GitHub*) to collaborate with others under version
control. We will describe how a research team can benefit from using a version
control platform to work collaboratively.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- List benefits of using a version control platform to collaborate
on research projects, particularly for reproducibility 
- Describe the difference between version control (e.g., *git*) and 
a version control platform (e.g., *GitLab*)

### git and GitHub features

- contributions
- branching
- versioning

**VC platforms as a form of back-up.**

One study surveyed neuroscience researchers at a UK institute. "The backup 'rule
of three' states that for a file to be sufficiently backed up it should be kept
in three separate locations using two different types of media with one offsite
backup. A lack of an adequate backup solution could mean permanently lost data,
effort and time. In this research, more than 82% of the respondents seemed to be
unaware of suitable backup procedures to protect their data. Some respondents
kept a single backup of work on external hard disks. Others used the
Universities local networked servers as their means of backup."

"A good approach is to store at least three copies in at least two
geographically distributed locations (e.g., original location such as a desktop
computer, an external hard drive, and one or more remote sites) and to adopt a
regular schedule for duplicating the data (i.e., backup)." [@michener2015ten]


> "One reason for GitHub's success is that it offers more than a simple source
code hosting service. It provides developers and researchers with a dynamic
and collaborative environment, often referred to as a social coding platform, 
that supports peer review, commenting, and discussion. A diverse range of efforts, 
ranging from individual to large bioinformatics projects, laboratory repositories, 
as well as global collaborations, have found GitHub to be a productive place
to share code and ideas and collaborate." [@perez2016ten]

Some scientists also use the combination of git and GitHub to collaborate
on writing scientific
manuscripts and grant proposals [@perez2016ten]. 

For software development projects, funding agencies may ask for plans on how to maintain
access to products if the main package is "orphaned". 

**Email attachments in lieu of common access files.**

...

For example, one group of researchers investigated a large collection of emails
from Enron [@hermans2015enron]. They found that passing Excel files through
email attachements was a common practice, and that messages within emails
suggested that spreadsheets were stored locally, rather than in a location that
was accessible to all team members [@hermans2015enron], which meant that team
members might often be working on different versions of the same spreadsheet
file. They note that "the practice of emailing spreadsheets is known to result in 
serious problems in terms of accountability and errors, as people do not have
access to the latest version of a spreadsheet, but need to be updated of changes 
via email." [@hermans2015enron]

"Team members regularly pass data files back and forth by hand, by email, and by
using shared lab or project servers, websites, and databases."
[@edwards2011science]

**Version control for spreadsheets**

"Recent versions of spreadsheets now incorporate a 'Traack Changes' functionality
which enables highlighting of changes made by different users along with a comment
and review system. Such tools are a start toward this but more robust version control
systems are required particularly in the context of increasingly online and 
collaborative method of working where large teams interact with a single document
concurrently." [@birch2018future]
