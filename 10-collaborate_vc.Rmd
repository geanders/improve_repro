## Enhance the reproducibility of collaborative research with version control platforms

Once a researcher has learned to use *git* on their own computer for
local version control, they can begin using version control platforms (e.g.,
*GitLab*, *GitHub*) to collaborate with others under version
control. We will describe how a research team can benefit from using a version
control platform to work collaboratively.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- List benefits of using a version control platform to collaborate
on research projects, particularly for reproducibility 
- Describe the difference between version control (e.g., *git*) and 
a version control platform (e.g., *GitLab*)
