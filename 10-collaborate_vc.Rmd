## Enhance the reproducibility of collaborative research with version control platforms

Once a researcher has learned to use *git* on their own computer for
local version control, they can begin using version control platforms (e.g.,
*GitLab*, *GitHub*) to collaborate with others under version
control. We will describe how a research team can benefit from using a version
control platform to work collaboratively.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- List benefits of using a version control platform to collaborate
on research projects, particularly for reproducibility 
- Describe the difference between version control (e.g., *git*) and 
a version control platform (e.g., *GitLab*)

### Subsection 1

**VC platforms as a form of back-up.**

One study surveyed neuroscience researchers at a UK institute. "The backup 'rule
of three' states that for a file to be sufficiently backed up it should be kept
in three separate locations using two different types of media with one offsite
backup. A lack of an adequate backup solution could mean permanently lost data,
effort and time. In this research, more than 82% of the respondents seemed to be
unaware of suitable backup procedures to protect their data. Some respondents
kept a single backup of work on external hard disks. Others used the
Universities local networked servers as their means of backup."

"A good approach is to store at least three copies in at least two
geographically distributed locations (e.g., original location such as a desktop
computer, an external hard drive, and one or more remote sites) and to adopt a
regular schedule for duplicating the data (i.e., backup)." [@michener2015ten]
