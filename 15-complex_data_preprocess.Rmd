## Complex data types in experimental data pre-processing

Raw data from many biomedical experiments, especially those that use
high-throughput techniques, can be very large and complex. Because of the scale
and complexity of these data, software for pre-processing the data in R often
uses complex, 'untidy' data formats. While these formats are necessary for
computational efficiency, they add a critical barrier for researchers wishing to
implement reproducibility tools. In this module, we will explain why use of
complex data formats is often necessary within open source pre-processing
software and outline the hurdles created in reproducibility tool use among
laboratory-based scientists.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Explain why R software for pre-processing biomedical data often stores 
data in complex, 'untidy' formats 
- Describe how these complex data formats can create barriers to 
laboratory-based researchers seeking to use reproducibility tools for 
data pre-processing
