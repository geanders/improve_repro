## Introduction to scripted data pre-processing in R

We will show how to implement scripted pre-processing of experimental data
through R scripts. We will demonstrate the difference between interactive coding
and code scripts, using R for examples. We will then demonstrate how to create,
save, and run an R code script for a simple data cleaning task.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Describe what an R code script is and how it differs from interactive
coding in R 
- Create and save an R script to perform a simple data pre-processing task 
- Run an R script
- List some popular packages in R for pre-processing biomedical data
