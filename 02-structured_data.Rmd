## Principles and power of structured data formats

The format in which experimental data is recorded can have a large influence on
how easy and likely it is to implement reproducibility tools in later stages of
the research workflow. Recording data in a "structured" format brings many
benefits. In this module, we will explain what makes a dataset "structured" and
why this format is a powerful tool for reproducible research.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- List the characteristics of a structured data format 
- Describe benefits for research transparency and reproducibility 
- Outline other benefits of using a structured format when recording data
