General comments on 2.1.

An example would be good to include in this openeing module 
- something simple and "reeal world". One possibility 
is the mouse colony worksheept - but something else might be preferable.
Some details are in the email [March 7 Subject: Fwd: GM-CSF KO mouse colony]

Each of the major points could then be illustrated using the example.

An additional point to consider is that spreadsheets are a programming
environment, but in which it is not easy to follow good programming
practices [for example as outlined in Wilson et al,. Best
Practices in Scientific Computing,  PLOS Biology 2014 12(1)] 

There are a large number of citations to Anderson et al 2007. The
major points of that paper could maybe be summarized in a 
more compact form.
