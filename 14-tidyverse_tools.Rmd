## Simplify scripted pre-processing through R's 'tidyverse' tools

The R programming language now includes a collection of 'tidyverse' extension
packages that enable user-friendly yet powerful work with experimental data,
including pre-processing and exploratory visualizations. The principle behind
the 'tidyverse' is that a collection of simple, general tools can be joined
together to solve complex problems, as long as a consistent format is used for
the input and output of each tool (the 'tidy' data format taught in other
modules). In this module, we will explain why this 'tidyverse' system is so
powerful and how it can be leveraged within biomedical research, especially for
reproducibly pre-processing experimental data.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Define R's 'tidyverse' system 
- Explain how the 'tidyverse' collection of packages can be both user-friendly
and powerful in solving many complex tasks with data
- Describe the difference between base R and R's 'tidyverse'.
