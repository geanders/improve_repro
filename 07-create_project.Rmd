## Creating 'Project' templates

Researchers can use RStudio's 'Projects' can facilitate collecting research
files in a single, structured directory, with the added benefit of easy use of
version control. Researchers can gain even more benefits by consistently
structuring all their 'Project' directories. We will demonstrate how to
implement structured project directories through RStudio, as well as how RStudio
enables the creation of a 'Project' for initializing consistently-structured
directories for all of a research group's projects.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Be able to create a structured `Project` directory within RStudio
- Understand how RStudio can be used to create 'Project' templates
