## Example: Creating a 'Project' template {#module8}

We will walk through a real example, based on the experiences of one of our
Co-Is, of establishing the format for a research group's 'Project' template,
creating that template using RStudio, and initializing a new research project
directory using the created template. This example will be from a
laboratory-based research group that studies the efficacy of tuberculosis drugs
in a murine model.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Create a 'Project' template in RStudio to initialize consistently-formatted
'Project' directories
- Initialize a new 'Project' directory using this template
