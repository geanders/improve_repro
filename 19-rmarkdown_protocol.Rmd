## RMarkdown for creating reproducible data pre-processing protocols

The R extension package RMarkdown can be used to create documents that combine
code and text in a 'knitted' document, and it has become a popular tool for
improving the computational reproducibility and efficiency of the data analysis
stage of research. This tool can also be used earlier in the research process,
however, to improve reproducibility of pre-processing steps. In this module, we
will provide detailed instructions on how to use RMarkdown in RStudio to create
documents that combine code and text. We will show how an RMarkdown document
describing a data pre-processing protocol can be used to efficiently apply the
same data pre-processing steps to different sets of raw data.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Define RMarkdown and the documents it can create 
- Explain how RMarkdown can be used to improve the reproducibility of research
projects at the data pre-processing phase
- Create a document in RStudio using 
- Apply it to several different datasets with the same format
