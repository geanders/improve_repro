## Using git and GitLab to implement version control

For many years, use of version control required use of the command line,
limiting its accessibility to researchers with limited programming experience.
However, graphical interfaces have removed this barrier, and RStudio has
particularly user-friendly tools for implementing version control. In this
module, we will show how to use *git* through RStudio's user-friendly
interface and how to connect from a local computer to *GitLab* through
RStudio.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Understand how to set up and use *git* through RStudio's interface 
- Understand how to connect with *GitLab* through RStudio to collaborate on  
research projects while maintaining version control
