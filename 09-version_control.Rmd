## Harnessing version control for transparent data recording

As a research project progresses, a typical practice in many experimental
research groups is to save new versions of files (e.g., 'draft1.doc',
'draft2.doc'), so that changes can be reverted. However, this practice leads to
an explosion of files, and it becomes hard to track which files represent the
'current' state of a project. Version control allows researchers to edit and
change research project files more cleanly, while maintaining the power to
'backtrack' to previous versions, messages included to explain changes. We will
explain what version control is and how it can be used in research projects to
improve the transparency and reproducibility of research, particularly for data
recording.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Describe version control  
- Explain how version control can be used to improve reproducibility 
for data recording

"Or maybe your goal is that your data is *usable* in a wide range of
applications? If so, consider adopting standard formats and metadata 
standards early on. At the very least, keep track of versions of data
and code, with associated dates." [@goodman2014ten]


**Email attachments in lieu of common access files.**

...

For example, one group of researchers investigated a large collection of emails
from Enron [@hermans2015enron]. They found that passing Excel files through
email attachements was a common practice, and that messages within emails
suggested that spreadsheets were stored locally, rather than in a location that
was accessible to all team members [@hermans2015enron], which meant that team
members might often be working on different versions of the same spreadsheet
file. They note that "the practice of emailing spreadsheets is known to result in 
serious problems in terms of accountability and errors, as people do not have
access to the latest version of a spreadsheet, but need to be updated of changes 
via email." [@hermans2015enron]

"Team members regularly pass data files back and forth by hand, by email, and by
using shared lab or project servers, websites, and databases."
[@edwards2011science]

**Version control for spreadsheets**

"Recent versions of spreadsheets now incorporate a 'Traack Changes' functionality
which enables highlighting of changes made by different users along with a comment
and review system. Such tools are a start toward this but more robust version control
systems are required particularly in the context of increasingly online and 
collaborative method of working where large teams interact with a single document
concurrently." [@birch2018future]
