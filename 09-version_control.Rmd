## Harnessing version control for transparent data recording

As a research project progresses, a typical practice in many experimental
research groups is to save new versions of files (e.g., 'draft1.doc',
'draft2.doc'), so that changes can be reverted. However, this practice leads to
an explosion of files, and it becomes hard to track which files represent the
'current' state of a project. Version control allows researchers to edit and
change research project files more cleanly, while maintaining the power to
'backtrack' to previous versions, messages included to explain changes. We will
explain what version control is and how it can be used in research projects to
improve the transparency and reproducibility of research, particularly for data
recording.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Describe version control  
- Explain how version control can be used to improve reproducibility 
for data recording
