## Harnessing version control for transparent data recording

As a research project progresses, a typical practice in many experimental
research groups is to save new versions of files (e.g., 'draft1.doc',
'draft2.doc'), so that changes can be reverted. However, this practice leads to
an explosion of files, and it becomes hard to track which files represent the
'current' state of a project. Version control allows researchers to edit and
change research project files more cleanly, while maintaining the power to
'backtrack' to previous versions, messages included to explain changes. We will
explain what version control is and how it can be used in research projects to
improve the transparency and reproducibility of research, particularly for data
recording.

**Objectives.** After this module, the trainee will be able to:

- Describe version control  
- Explain how version control can be used to improve reproducibility 
for data recording

### What is version control?

Version control developed as a way to coordinate collaborative work on 
software programming projects. The term "version" here refers to the current
state of a document or set of documents, for example the source code for a
computer program. The idea of "control" is to allow for safe changes and updates
to this version while more than one person is working on it. 
The general term "version control" can refer to any method of
syncing contributions from several people to a file or set of files, and
very early on it was done by people rather than through a computer program. 
Some software developers have shared their memories of taking their
code to the "Source Control" team, who then integrated it into the main
source code file by hand [@irving2011astonishments]. 

As the proverb about too many cooks in the kitchen captures, any time you have
multiple people working on a project, it introduces the chance for conflicts.
While higher-level conflicts, like about what you want the final product to look
like or who should do which jobs, can't be easily managed by a computer program,
now the complications of integrating everyone's contributions---and letting
people work in their own space and then bring together their individual work
into one final joint project---can be. While these programs for version control
were originally created to help with programmers developing code, they can be
used now to coordinate group work on numerous types of file-based projects,
including scientific manuscripts, books, and websites [@raymondunderstanding].
And although they can work with projects that include binary code, they thrive
in projects with a heavier concentration of text-based files, and so they fit in
nicely in a scientific research / data analysis workflow that is based on data
stored in plain text formats and data analysis scripts written in plain text
files, tools we discuss in other parts of this book.

In earlier types of version control programs, there was one central "main"
repository the file or set of files the team was working on
[@raymondunderstanding; @target2018version]. Very early on, this was kept on one
computer [@irving2011astonishments]. A team member who wanted to make a change
would "check out" the file he or she wanted to work on, make changes, and then
check it back in as the newest main version. While one team member had this file
checkout out, other members would often be "locked" out of making any changes to
that file---they could look at it, but couldn't make any edits
[@raymondunderstanding; @target2018version]. This meant that there was no chance
of two people trying to change the same part of a file at the same time. In
spirit, this early system is pretty similar to the idea of sending a file around
the team by email, with the understanding that only one person works on it at a
time. While the "main" version is in different people's hands at different
times, to do work, you all agree that only one person will work on it at a time.
A slightly more modern analogy is the idea of having a single version of a file
in Dropbox or Google Docs, and avoiding working on the file when you see that
another team member is working on it. (However, both of these examples other key
features of version control, which we'll discuss a bit later.)

> "In a medium-sized project, it often happens that a (relatively small) number
of people work simultaneously on a single set of files, the 'program' or the
'project'. Often these people have additional tasks, causing their working
speeds to differ greatly. One person may be working a steady ten hours a day on
the project, a second may have barely time to dabble in the project enough to
keep current, while a third participant may be sent off on an urgent temporary
assignment just before finishing a modification. It would be nice if each
participant could be abstracted from the vicissitudes of the lives of the
others." [@grune1986concurrent]

This system is pretty clunky, though. In particular, it probably usually
increases the amount of time that it takes the team to finish the project,
because only one person can work on a file at a time. Later types of version
control programs moved toward a different style, allowing for *distributed*
rather than *centralized* collaborative work on a file or a set of files
[@raymondunderstanding; @irving2011astonishments]. Under the distributed model,
all team members can have their own version of all the files, work on them and
make records of changes they make to the files, and then occassionally sync with
everyone else to share your changes with them and bring their changes into your
copy of the files. 

This functionality is called *concurrency*, since it allows team members to
concurrently work on the same set of files [@raymondunderstanding]. This idea
allowed for the development of other useful features and styles of working,
including *branching* to try out new ideas that you're not sure you'll
ultimately want to go with and *forking*, a key tool used in open-source
software development, which among other things facilitates someone who isn't
part of the original team getting a copy of the files they can work with and
suggesting some changes that might be helpful.

So, this is the basic idea of modern version control---for a project that involves a set
of computer files, everyone on has their own copy of a directory with those files
on their own computer, makes changes at the time and in the spots in the files that
they want, and then regularly re-syncs their local directory with everyone else's
to share changes and updates. 

There is one key feature of modern version control that's
critical to making this work---merging files that started the same but were edited in
different ways and now need to be put back together, bringing any changes made from the
original version. This step is called *merging* the files. While this is typically 
described using the plural, "files", at a higher-level, you can thing of this as 
just merging the *changes* that two people have made as they edited a single file, a
file where they both started out with identical copies. 

Think of the file broken up into each of its separate lines. There will be some lines
that neither person changed. Those are easy to handle in the "merge"---they stay the
same as in the original copy of the file. Next, there will be some lines that one
person changed, but that the other person didn't. It turns out that these are pretty
easy to handle, too. If only one person changed the line, then you use their version---it's
the most up-to-date, since if both people started out with the same version, it means
that the other person didn't make any changes to that part of the file. 
Finally, there may be a few lines that both people changed. These are called *merge conflicts*. 
They're places in the file where there's not a clear, easy-to-automate way that
the computer can know which version to put into the integrated, latest version of the
file. Different version control programs handle these merge conflicts in different ways. 
For the most common version control program used today, *git*, these spots in the 
file are flagged with a special set of symbols when you try to integrate the two updated
versions of the file. Along with the special symbols to denote a conflict, there will 
also be *both* versions of the conflicting lines of the file. Whoever is integrating the 
files must go in and pick the version of those lines to use in the integrated version
of the file, or write in some compromise version of those lines that brings in elements
from both people's changes, and then delete all the symbols denoting that was a conflict
and save this latest version of the file. 

There are a number of other features of version control that make it useful for
collaborating on file-based projects with teams. First, these systems allow you
to explain your changes as you make them---in other words, it allows for
*annotation* of the developing and editing process [@raymondunderstanding]. This
provides the team with a full history of why the files evolved in the way they
did across the team. It also provides a way to communicate across the team
members. 

For example, if one person is the key person working on a certain file,
but has run into a problem with one spot and asks another team member to take a
go, then the second team member isn't limited to just looking at the file and
then emailing some suggestions. Instead, the second person can make sure he or
she has the latest version of that file, make the changes they think will help,
*commit* those changes with a message (a *commit message*) about why they think
this change will fix the problem, and then push that latest version of the file
back to the first person. If there are several places where it would help to
change the file, then these can be fixed through several separate commits, each
with their own message. The first person, who originally asked for help, can
read through the updates in the file (most platforms for using version control
will now highlight where all these changes are in the file) and read the second
person's message or messages about why each change might help. Even better, days
or months later, when team members are trying to figure out why a certain change
was made in that part of the file, can go back and read these messages to get an
explanation.

There's another feature of version control that can be demonstrated through this
example. Because the changes made to the files in the project are regularly
*committed*, with a message for each commit and a record of what was changed in
that commit, the team members can, at any point, go back to the *exact* version
of the project at any earlier point in time. Each of the commits is given its
own ID tag ([name for this? hash?]), and *git* has a number of commands that let
you "roll back" to earlier versions, by going back to the version as it was when
a certain commit was made, provided *reversability* within the project files
[@raymondunderstanding].

It turns out that this functionality---of being able to "roll back" to earlier
versions---has a wonderful side benefit when it comes to working on a large
project. It means that you **don't** need to save earlier versions of each file.
You can maintain one and only one version of each project file in the project's
directory, with the confidence that you never "lose" old versions of the file.
If you're working on a manuscript, for example, when it's time to edit, you can
cut whole paragraphs, and if you ever need to get them back, they'll be right
there in the commit history for your project, with their own commit message
about why they were cut (hopefully a nice clear one that will make it easy to
find that commit if you ever need those paragraphs again).


> "Have a quick look back up at those decades of progress. Yes, some of the advances
were also enabled by increasing computer power. But, mainly, they were simply
made by people thinking of cleverer ways of collaborating." [@irving2011astonishments]

The most common version control program currently used for scienctific projects is
*git*. This program was created by Linus Torvalds, who also created the Linux 
operating system, in 2005 as a way to facilitate the team working on Linux 
development. This program for version control thrives in large collaborative
projects, for example open-source software development projects that include
numerous contributors, both regular and occasional [@brown2018git].

> "If your software engineering career, like mine, is no older than GitHub, then 
git may be the only version control software you have ever used. While people 
sometimes grouse about its steep learning curve or unintuitive interface, git has
become everyone's go-to for version control." [@target2018version]

In recent years, some complementary tools have been developed that make the process of 
collaborating together using version control software easier. 
Other tools can helps in collaborating on file-based projects, including *bug trackers*
or *issue trackers*, which allow the team to keep a running "to-do" list of what needs
to be done to complete the project. Other helpful tools, particularly for compiled
software projects, include *build systems*. Some of these features come within 
Software Configuration Management (SCM) programs [@raymondunderstanding]

GitHub was created in 2008 as a web-based platform to facilitate collaborating
on projects running under git version control. It can provide an easier entry
to using git for version control than trying to learn to use git from the
command line [@perez2016ten]. It also plays well with RStudio, making it easy
to integrate a collaborative workflow through GitHub from the same RStudio
window on your computer where you are otherwise doing your analysis [@perez2016ten].

> "The astonishment was that you might want to make even your tiny hacks to 
other people's code public. Before GitHub, we tended to keep those on our own
computer. Nowadays, it is so each to make a fork, or even edit the code directly 
in your browser, that potentially anyone can find even your least polished
bug fixes immediately." [@irving2011astonishments]

On GitHub, you can set the access to a project to be either public or private,
and can be converted easily from one form to the other over the course of the
project [@metz2015github]. A private project can be viewed only by fellow team
members, while a public project can be viewed by anyone. What's more, while only
collaborators on a public project can directly change the code, anyone else can
*suggest* changes through a process of copying a version of the project
(*forking* it), making the changes they would like to suggest, and the asking
the project's owners to consider integrating the changes back into the main
version of the project through a *pull request*. GitHub therefore creates a
platform where people can explore, adapt, and add to other people's coding
projects, enabling a community of coders [@perez2016ten].

> "Much more than a code warehouse, GitHub is effectively a social network for
software development." [@perkel2018git]

> GitHub has been described as "a kind of bazaar that offers just about any 
piece of code you might want---and so much of it free." [@metz2015github]

GitHub can also be used to collaborate on, host, and publish websites and other
online content [@perez2016ten]. It's GitHub Pages functionality, for example, is
now being used to host a number of books created in R using the `bookdown`
package, including the online version of this book.

### Improving scientific research with version control

[Electronic notebooks? Original lab notebooks? Idea of tracking any changes to
the recorded data?]

...

> "One reason for GitHub's success is that it offers more than a simple source
code hosting service. It provides developers and researchers with a dynamic
and collaborative environment, often referred to as a social coding platform, 
that supports peer review, commenting, and discussion. A diverse range of efforts, 
ranging from individual to large bioinformatics projects, laboratory repositories, 
as well as global collaborations, have found GitHub to be a productive place
to share code and ideas and collaborate." [@perez2016ten]

Large funding agencies often now require a plan for managing and sharing data. ...
For software development projects, they may ask for plans on how to maintain
access to products if the main package is "orphaned". 

Some scientists have started using git and GitHub as a way to collaborate on 
writing scientific manuscripts [@perez2016ten] and grant proposals [examples].

### Subsection 1


"Or maybe your goal is that your data is *usable* in a wide range of
applications? If so, consider adopting standard formats and metadata 
standards early on. At the very least, keep track of versions of data
and code, with associated dates." [@goodman2014ten]


**Email attachments in lieu of common access files.**

...

For example, one group of researchers investigated a large collection of emails
from Enron [@hermans2015enron]. They found that passing Excel files through
email attachements was a common practice, and that messages within emails
suggested that spreadsheets were stored locally, rather than in a location that
was accessible to all team members [@hermans2015enron], which meant that team
members might often be working on different versions of the same spreadsheet
file. They note that "the practice of emailing spreadsheets is known to result in 
serious problems in terms of accountability and errors, as people do not have
access to the latest version of a spreadsheet, but need to be updated of changes 
via email." [@hermans2015enron]

"Team members regularly pass data files back and forth by hand, by email, and by
using shared lab or project servers, websites, and databases."
[@edwards2011science]

**Version control for spreadsheets**

"Recent versions of spreadsheets now incorporate a 'Traack Changes' functionality
which enables highlighting of changes made by different users along with a comment
and review system. Such tools are a start toward this but more robust version control
systems are required particularly in the context of increasingly online and 
collaborative method of working where large teams interact with a single document
concurrently." [@birch2018future]
